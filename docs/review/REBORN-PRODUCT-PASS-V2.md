| --- | --- | --- |
| Root items | 5 (Music, Now Playing, Queue, Connectivity, Settings) | 4 (Music, Now Playing, Queue, Settings) |
| Normal routes (screens + platform pages) | about 45 (v1 map: 55 rows incl. diagnostics) | 27 |
| Diagnostics routes | 13 + Capabilities/Result | 1 root + 13 sections |
| Settings rows across all settings pages | 38 (incl. Connectivity, Quick Settings, Power) | 28 + 6 in the Quick Settings sheet |
| Routes printing platform commands | 6 reset-scope pages | 0 |
| Focusable "fact" rows on normal pages | Every About/Storage/Power/USB/Update fact | 0 (static facts) |

## 3. Unavailable cleanup

Before: 67 "unavailable / not available / not exposed" occurrences in UI and
application sources, including generic value rendering of every missing
platform field as *Unavailable* on normal pages. After: no user-visible
normal-page string uses that pattern (enforced by
`normal_screens_never_show_engineering_terms_or_generic_unavailable` and
`empty_library_states_name_the_problem_without_generic_unavailable`).
Internal error strings remain in the application but are mapped by
`friendly_error` (*Wi-Fi is starting. Try again in a moment.*). Diagnostics
states a missing field as *Not reported*, which is accurate there.

## 4. Boot

* **Old**: stock preloader/LK logo → kernel → initramfs splash with a
  photographic scene, taglines and a bouncing bar → a different Reborn boot
  screen (*Reborn / MUSIC LIVES ON / Starting music services*) → UI.
* **New**: preloader and LK unchanged → the initramfs splash shows the Reborn
  mark on `#090B0D` with a breathing gold rule → Reborn takes the display
  with the pixel-identical frame → 6-frame dissolve into the UI.
* **Stage ownership**: LK logo (stock, untouched) → `reborn-splash` from the
  initramfs after the unchanged charger and voltage gate (`KD_GRAPHICS`
  keeps fbcon hidden) → Reborn via the existing READY/RELEASED/PRESENTED
  handoff.
* **Timing**: no wait was added. The splash pulse costs one 40×2 px fill
  per 50 ms poll that already existed; the dissolve starts only after the
  first UI frame is ready and lasts ~200 ms. The Y2 was not run, so splash
  visibility, process start, first frame and ready times were not measured
  on hardware; Reborn's `startup.phase` events and the splash
  `events.jsonl` record them on the next boot.
* **Flashes**: the background is the same `#090B0D` in the splash, Reborn's
  first frame and the UI; fbcon stays in `KD_GRAPHICS`. The LK→kernel
  transition is owned by stock firmware and was not changed.

## 5. Shutdown

* **Old**: Reborn saved state and exited after its acknowledgement. Its DRM
  device closed with the backlight on, so the kernel's fbdev emulation
  restored its own buffer (stale, console or white) until power was cut.
* **New**: UI fades (7 frames) → Reborn mark (*Battery empty* on
  low-battery shutdown) while audio, session and database close → mark fades
  → black frame → backlight off (`bl_power`) → acknowledgement → exit. The
  DRM device stays open until the process exits. Visuals take ~0.9 s.
* **Platform**: the coordinator turns every backlight off after stopping or
  killing Reborn and before `busybox poweroff/reboot`, so a crashed or hung
  Reborn still ends dark. The platform deadline (10 s for user requests) and
  its continuation without an acknowledgement are unchanged.

## 7. Wheel

* **Root cause** (software, from source): `InputManager::poll_at` gave every
  record of a 15 ms read batch the same `Instant::now()` and accelerated
  from the *second* same-direction event within 180 ms
  (`previous_steps + 1`). Two real detents read in one batch, or one bounced
  data-ready edge re-reading the latched APT32F frame (the driver emits a
  press/release pair per IRQ), moved 1 + 2 rows; brisk rotation reached 3–6
  rows per detent. The physical bounce rate was not captured on hardware.
* **Path**: APT32F I²C frame → `apt32f-wheel` KEY_UP/PAGEUP/DOWN/PAGEDOWN
  press+release → evdev → `InputManager` (cadence, dedupe) →
  `NormalizedInput::Wheel*` → `ActionRouter` (screen-off drop) →
  `Action::Wheel*` → `Ui::wheel` (context policy).
* **Dedupe**: kernel timestamps (`EVIOCSCLOCKID` → monotonic); same direction
  under 8 ms is one detent; releases and autorepeat are never detents.
* **Acceleration**: 1 step until four detents of one rotation; then 2 (≤110 ms
  smoothed interval), 3 (≤70 ms after 6), 4 (≤45 ms after 10). Reset after
  220 ms, on reversal, device loss or a backwards clock.
* **Contexts**: long library lists use the suggestion; everything else one
  step; Now Playing volume ±2.

## 9. Information removed from normal screens

Kernel version, boot ID, kernel taint, Reborn/Y2Linux commits, build ID,
rootfs version, platform build; CPU frequency/governor/idle states, load,
memory, die temperatures, cooling; SOC source/confidence/calibration, supply
voltage, current, pack temperature, low-battery policy; filesystem, UUID,
controller clocks, transport errors; IP, route, DNS, signal dBm, RX/TX;
SFTP/SSH, USB address, authentication, DMA counters; BlueZ/BlueALSA, PCM
format/rate/channels, codec policy, trust, reconnect state; ALSA format,
rate, hw_params, decoder/DSP formats; update scope, journal, signing key ID,
sequence, rollback; capability implemented/enabled/qualified flags; reset
plan commands; benchmark controls.

## 10. Feature UX summary

Music, Queue, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, codec, USB, battery, storage, update and
reset behave as described in [Product UI v2](../ui/REBORN-PRODUCT-UI-V2.md#screens).
The codec preference row is hidden on the current platform policy (SBC
only at runtime); it appears automatically when an enabled optional codec
is usable with the connected peer.

## 11. Performance

* Rendering stays dirty-flag driven at ≤30 fps, visible rows only. The boot
  dissolve renders 6 extra frames once; the shutdown 27 frames once.
* Platform polling: one worker instead of two; a `y2-platform` process runs
  only while a platform-backed screen is visible (every 15 s, 4 s on PC
  Transfer) or after an explicit operation, never with the display off.
  The previous design refreshed every 10 s on platform pages via a second
  worker.
* Screen-off cadence is unchanged (50 ms loop); no new wake sources.
  Battery remains a 2 s file read of the platform power record.

## 16. Remaining product limitations

* Battery percentage is the platform's provisional voltage estimate; there
  is no measured current or calibrated capacity.
* Software updates need an owner-configured update channel; without one the
  device says updates are installed with a computer.
* PC Transfer is authenticated SFTP over USB; it is not a USB mass-storage
  drive, and loaded USB transfer failed the last physical CPU qualification.
* Optional Bluetooth codecs remain disabled by platform policy, so SBC is
  the only codec offered.
* No sleep/suspend: screen-off keeps the system running.
* Brightness and the shutdown backlight sequence are implemented against the
  standard backlight class and were not physically observed.
