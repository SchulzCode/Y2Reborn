# Reborn radio inspection after owner splash installation

The owner reports that the flashed splash update works. Existing pinned owner
SSH confirms `Y2LINUX-REBORN-SPLASH-01`, Reborn source
`6209f48402a00a077759df042916f0ae2c89783a`, and the Mali400 hardware renderer.
The inspection used Reborn's existing JSON diagnostic commands. No application,
firmware, boot image, credentials or persistent radio preference was changed.

## Findings

Both radios were off at entry: `/data/network/enabled=0`, Wi-Fi rfkill soft block
set, and BlueZ `Powered=false`. The connectivity owner was activated/calibrated,
with no transport errors or recoveries. Supplicant, BlueZ and BlueALSA were alive.

Reborn's event ring records Wi-Fi power requests on → off → on → off, followed
by two scan errors while the interface was off. This proves the requested
sequence, not whether repeated user presses or key repeat caused it. Bluetooth
recorded five `org.bluez.Error.NotReady` responses while its adapter was off;
the existing Bluetooth error records omit the method, so they cannot identify
the exact failed UI operation on their own.

There are two confirmed application status/presentation defects:

- `crates/reborn-platform/src/wifi.rs::status` treats the normal absence of a
  per-interface supplicant socket when Wi-Fi is disabled as `unavailable` and
  sets an error. It does not distinguish Off, Starting and a missing service.
- `app/reborn/src/main.rs` copies every Wi-Fi status error into the global
  `Ui.notice`, regardless of the current screen. Successful updates do not clear
  that notice. A Wi-Fi error can therefore remain visible on Bluetooth and other
  screens. The Bluetooth event handler does not display its own `Status.error`.

The radio tests below succeed through the running Reborn process using the same
rfkill/supplicant and BlueZ D-Bus helpers as the application. They do not prove
network association, Bluetooth pairing or Bluetooth audio playback.

| SSH command | Physical result |
| --- | --- |
| `rebornctl test wifi-scan --json` | Pass; 28 networks, interface available; 5.129 s including SSH |
| `rebornctl test bluetooth --json` | Pass; adapter and BlueALSA available, no connected peer |
| `rebornctl test bluetooth-scan --seconds 10 --json` | Pass; powered adapter and completed discovery, 0 discoverable peers; 11.261 s including SSH |
| `rebornctl test baseline --json` | Pass; 10 checks including hardware graphics readback, six decoder formats/artwork, DB, storage and service availability; SD absent warning |

Final state matches entry: both radio preferences remain off, Wi-Fi soft block
restored, BlueZ powered off, same Reborn session and boot ID. No increase in
Wi-Fi/Bluetooth errors, audio XRUNs, playback errors or graphics context losses
during these tests. Kernel connectivity status still reports `error=0`,
`transport_errors=0`, `recoveries=0`.

For this deployed build, select **Turn Wi-Fi on** or **Turn Bluetooth on** once,
wait several seconds for activation, then select Scan. After activation the first
row changes to **Turn … off**; selecting it again disables the radio. Bluetooth
discovery additionally needs a nearby peer in pairing/discoverable mode. A stale
Wi-Fi footer is not evidence that Bluetooth is unavailable.

## Evidence and limits

[Machine-readable summary](evidence/radio-inspection-20260918.json). Full bounded
local captures, including the before/after snapshots, subsystem logs and kernel
radio excerpts, are retained under
`out/radio-inspection-20260918T115744Z/`; they are not committed because future
captures may contain local network or peer identifiers. No passwords, bond keys,
SSH private keys or raw calibration records were read.

The splash reports console hidden at boot 698 ms, visible at 828 ms, READY release
at 49,448 ms and the first Reborn frame presented at 49,456 ms. This agrees with
the owner's successful visible boot report. It is not an offline-charging,
suspend/resume or complete Reborn Baseline 01 acceptance result. This inspection
does not install a UI status fix or leave the radios enabled.
