# Platform v1 application integration

The validated candidate source pair is Linux
`d04b95aaff713edf943042d97a4c6134ca19fc24` / Reborn
`6c8aa128550ec80addd08ef3145e9d5a846ddf2e`. Closing commits change documentation
only. Final Reborn host workspace tests: **155 passed**, formatting and strict
all-target clippy passed. Fresh Buildroot/Reborn ARM, eight QEMU userspace checks,
installed defaults and the real 1k ARM database/scanner/UI benchmark pass.
The platform image/package validation includes these exact installed binaries.
Historical ARM-pending notes below describe original checkpoints and are
superseded by those receipts. No physical application/Bluetooth qualification
or target performance acceptance occurred; larger 10k/20k results are host
measurements until owner qualification.


Started 2026-09-23 from Reborn `d9ba0549e6b34eff029bd13f7c33a491fee09e66`;
Y2Linux starts at `5f6b4468fb43605ca1da679420823afa72cea73f`. Existing untracked
review/audit/codec documents in the original checkout are preserved. Work is in
an isolated local branch while the previous committed pair builds. No device
access, flashing, push or identity change. Later correctness-closure fixes are
retained; no older repaired defect is reintroduced as an outstanding issue.

`reborn-bench` measures the actual library schema/open/list/upsert/scan code at
1k, 10k and 20k tracks plus current UI catalog/wheel and queue operations. It
requires an inherited empty scratch directory FD and refuses an existing DB.
The platform creates and pins that directory. No real media/DB/state is used.
SQLite WAL/NORMAL and 64-track batching stay unchanged. First-connection and
warm reopen are labelled without claiming a cold OS cache or cold device.
Synthetic short-WAV scanning is metadata work, not playback throughput.

`cargo test -p reborn-library --locked benchmark::tests -- --nocapture`: passed
the real-schema/count/existing-DB refusal case. `cargo build -p reborn --bin
reborn-bench --release --locked`: passed fresh host release build. ARM, target
performance and physical qualification remain pending. Host workload results
and subsequent integration changes are recorded below as they are completed.

Host runs completed 1k/10k/20k synthetic database and scanner workloads with no
failures. Raw output is in Y2Linux `out/platform-v1-host-measurements/`. At 20k,
initial synthetic-WAV scan was 11.705 s; unchanged scan was 0.411 s. These are
x86 host filesystem/cache results during an unrelated ARM build, not Y2 budgets.
No SQLite schema, index, cache or durability policy was tuned from these numbers.

Measured wheel row generation at 1k/10k/20k had medians 0.129370 / 1.333516 /
2.712791 ms. The focused correction counts matches without allocating each row,
formats only the visible song page, and temporarily borrows the model's library
for semantic input instead of cloning every Track. After a fresh release build,
wheel medians were 0.002074 / 0.016462 / 0.032904 ms. UI output remains bounded by
the existing visible layout, with original catalog indices retained. Queue and
SQLite remain authoritative; no cache hierarchy or ORM was added.

`cargo test -p reborn-ui -p reborn --bin reborn --lib --locked`: 13 UI and 27
runtime tests passed. New 20k filtered-page test checks visible focus, final row
identity, modal bounds and restoration of the exact library allocation. New
platform images also require a matching SD mount claim/UUID/boot before an SD
source is advertised, while older images retain the existing compatibility path.
ARM and physical latency/UI/card qualification are still pending.


Power integration: normal shutdown requests use the platform socket when its
contract is installed. Current-boot intent triggers audio/session/SQLite close;
acknowledgement reports failures truthfully. The database worker checkpoints and
closes before replying. Runtime/library/platform host suites and targeted real
checkpoint/close test pass. Hardware transitions/low-battery thresholds remain
Y2Linux owner-controlled qualification; no electrical limit is chosen here.


Network/storage integration: fresh platform network readiness is distinct from
wpa_supplicant association; Online requires platform IP/route/DNS observation.
Boot/time freshness is validated. Platform media maintenance owns automatic
mount/unmount; Reborn no longer initiates those actions on new platform images.
Source claims validate the sysfs instance in addition to mount/boot/UUID, rejecting
same-minor reuse. Targeted freshness and four storage tests pass. ARM validation
for this revision follows separately; phase-2 QEMU evidence is not transferred.


AVRCP: BlueZ Media1 registration exports Reborn's existing playback model and
metadata. An eight-command bounded queue delivers semantic Play/Pause/Next/
Previous actions; only the current BlueZ owner can invoke them. Two host tests
pass, including private D-Bus registration, authorized control, unauthorized
sender rejection and unchanged metadata until the actual model changes. No
remote playback or physical radio qualification is claimed; ARM build pending.

Bluetooth user actions now share the platform reconnect operation lock. Pending
connect/power intents inhibit automatic recovery; successful explicit completion
re-arms it. Client timeout or D-Bus loss stays inhibited until owner retry.
34 platform tests pass; ARM/image validation follows in the next build.

`rebornctl bluetooth codec Auto|SBC ADDRESS` submits a bounded explicit codec
session while playback is stopped. The platform inventory, runtime manager and
GetCodecs intersection determine typed eligibility. Auto requires physical and
distribution approval; this unqualified candidate therefore fails Auto closed.
Manual SBC remains available for owner qualification. The policy tries at most
two preferred codecs plus conformant SBC, never revisits a candidate and never
automatically promotes after fallback. Optional encoders are absent.

PCM probes/handles hold shared leases; selection requires an exclusive lease.
Unknown selection outcome retains an on-disk gate until BlueALSA owner replacement,
including app death during the request. Negotiated codec/format/rate/channels
always come from the actual PCM; selection success is AwaitingNegotiatedObservation.
The existing transport invalidation logic still governs playback. Codec controls
are exposed through the stable control API/CLI; a richer preferences UI is deferred.


Application boot readiness is emitted only after actual KMS first-frame success
and runtime worker creation, with boot ID/PID/start ticks. The platform verifies
current generation, responsiveness, core interfaces and update source identity
before acknowledging boot health. Headless/QEMU startup never supplies a fake
physical first-frame receipt. Reborn exposes typed versioned platform capability
reading with absent flags false, plus `--default-settings` so settings-only reset
uses the installed schema/defaults without discarding queue or position.
Incomplete owner maintenance prevents application startup until explicit resume.

Bluetooth Auto/AVRCP, shutdown and SD/readiness contracts are platform foundations,
not a second application authority. The existing FFmpeg DSP, SQLite single writer,
semantic Actions and bounded workers remain. Optional codec preferences UI,
target library/performance budgets and physical validation remain follow-up
application/owner work; unsupported platform features must stay explicit.

See Y2Linux's [completion ledger](../../../Y2Linux/docs/validation/PLATFORM-V1-COMPLETION.md)
and [owner qualification sessions](../../../Y2Linux/docs/validation/PLATFORM-V1-OWNER-QUALIFICATION.md)
for separate software, ARM/image and physical/endurance evidence. Return general
application development here after the owner qualifies the advertised core;
do not reopen gated hardware scope as incidental application work.
