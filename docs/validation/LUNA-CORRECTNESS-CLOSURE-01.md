# Luna correctness closure 01

Date: 2026-09-22. Software-only closure record for the finite findings in the
latest independent review. No physical Y2 was accessed, paired, configured,
flashed, or tested. This record distinguishes host/source evidence from
physical qualification.

## Starting state and boundary

| Repository | Starting HEAD | Starting worktree |
|---|---|---|
| Y2Linux | `8e5b53bc9fb934e1f668b9e7e9e34f0fc5e4130e` | clean; `main` ahead 29 |
| Y2Reborn | `8a1443daa25419834c800a7f9d707e66f80e0f90` | `main` ahead 37; pre-existing untracked `docs/audit/`, `docs/review/`, and `docs/architecture/bluetooth-codecs.md` preserved |

Y2Linux roadmap boundary audit: commit `8c485b6`. It records the retained
GPU-01, CONNECTIVITY-10, and M4 evidence limits, current open platform issues,
and that this work neither closes a platform milestone nor authorizes hardware
activity. The architecture and hardware exclusions in the request remain in
force. No candidate exists yet.

## R1 — render and persistence intent

**Status: FIXED**

- **Finding and symptom:** Runtime used one `dirty` boolean for frame redraw
  and session persistence. A render could suppress a position checkpoint; a
  save could suppress the redraw requested by a setting or service notice.
- **Current source confirmation:** `Runtime` previously cleared the same flag
  after `model.checkpoint()` and after drawing; its 15-second save condition
  also depended on that flag.
- **Implementation:** Split runtime dirtiness into `render` and `persistence`
  state. Draw success clears only `render`; checkpoint success clears only
  `persistence`; checkpoint failure retains persistence intent. Position and
  queue-boundary changes request persistence, which is serviced at the existing
  15-second cadence. Setting, playback, Bluetooth-loss and source changes keep
  their required redraw/save behavior. Removed a redundant second Bluetooth-loss
  checkpoint.
- **Files changed:** `app/reborn/src/main.rs`.
- **Tests added:** Seven runtime dirty-state tests for stopped screen-timeout
  save/redraw, render-before-save, save-before-render, Bluetooth-loss notice,
  position cadence after rendering, unchanged state, and failed checkpoint
  retry intent.
- **Tests run:** `cargo fmt --all -- --check`; `cargo test -p reborn --bin reborn
  --locked runtime_dirty_tests` — 7 passed.
- **Result:** Separate runtime intents; targeted host tests pass.
- **Commit:** `f081a78` (`Separate render and persistence dirty state`).
- **Remaining limitation:** This is software/runtime-state evidence. The
  current candidate's physical UI and persistence behavior remain
  `PHYSICAL_QUALIFICATION_PENDING`.
- **Evidence tier:** source inspection + fresh targeted host test.

## R2 — signed 24-bit PCM in a 32-bit container

**Status: FIXED**

- **Finding and symptom:** Rust represented `S24_LE` as four bytes, but the C
  media membrane mapped format code 3 to S16. Nonzero S32-to-S24 output was
  consequently corrupted; the previous zero-only test could not expose it.
- **Current source confirmation:** The Rust format model already specified
  24 valid bits and 32 physical bits. The ALSA C mapping selected
  `SND_PCM_FORMAT_S24_LE`, while FFmpeg conversion and decoder output treated
  code 3 as S16. ALSA documents `S24_LE` as signed 24-bit LE using the low three
  bytes in a 32-bit word; `S24_3LE` is a separate packed three-byte format.
  See the [ALSA PCM format reference](https://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/group___p_c_m.html)
  and [PCM transfer semantics](https://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/pcm.html).
- **Implementation:** Preserve the existing model's four-byte sample/eight-
  byte stereo-frame sizing and document the low-three-byte LE contract. FFmpeg
  converts through S32 Q31; native packing takes the signed top 24 bits, writes
  them into bytes 0–2, and zeros the padding byte. S24 input ignores padding,
  sign-extends the low 24 bits into Q31, and S24-to-S24 normalizes padding.
  Decoder and crossfade paths use the same packing boundary. ALSA code 3 maps
  to `SND_PCM_FORMAT_S24_LE`; unknown codes are rejected, and runtime format
  reporting checks ALSA valid/physical widths. Receipt text says
  `s24le-in-32` rather than claiming FFmpeg has a packed S24 sample format.
- **Files changed:** `crates/reborn-core/src/lib.rs`,
  `crates/reborn-media/native/media.c`, `crates/reborn-media/src/native.rs`,
  `crates/reborn-audio/native/audio.c`, `crates/reborn-audio/src/native.rs`.
- **Tests added:** Exact S32-to-S24 bytes for zero, ±1-LSB, half-scale, maximum
  positive and minimum negative values in distinct stereo channels; S24-to-S32
  sign extension with ignored padding; actual decoded FLTP-to-S24 output
  compared sample-for-sample with S32 top bits and frame counts; S24
  crossfade; ALSA valid/physical-width mapping; unsupported-format rejection;
  and core byte/valid-bit sizing.
- **Tests run:** `cargo fmt --all -- --check`; `cargo test --locked -p
  reborn-core -p reborn-media -p reborn-audio` — 32 passed, 0 failed.
- **Result:** Nonzero and extreme sample packing, conversion, stereo order,
  frame accounting, ALSA mapping, and fail-closed behavior pass on the host.
- **Commit:** `f90f9fb` (`Fix signed 24-bit PCM container conversion`).
- **Remaining limitation:** No optional Bluetooth codec was enabled. No Y2
  sample playback or high-resolution wired behavior is claimed;
  `PHYSICAL_QUALIFICATION_PENDING`.
- **Evidence tier:** source inspection + host native-library tests + local ALSA
  format-width query + official ALSA documentation.

## R3 — transactional sink reconfiguration

**Status: FIXED**

- **Finding and symptom:** Reconfiguration released the old sink, but planning
  or opening the replacement could fail after callers had already changed
  output, queue, playback position, or DSP settings. The open command was
  fire-and-forget, and the release's two-second timeout began only after a
  blocking command-channel send.
- **Current source confirmation:** `Runtime::load()` previously planned after
  release but mutated `Buffering` state and submitted the replacement without
  waiting for the sink actor's factory result. `Playback::stop_and_wait()` used
  blocking `send()` before calling `recv_timeout(2s)`.
- **Implementation:** Reconfiguration now runs release acknowledgement,
  sink planning, and nonblocking worker-open enqueue. The sink actor has a
  direct one-slot open-result reply which the runtime polls while the UI loop
  continues. Decoder start and model persistence occur only after the open
  acknowledgement; a failed or timed-out open invalidates its generation and
  queues release. A sink-open guard refuses a second open until the prior
  release is acknowledged. The two-second release deadline covers retrying a
  full command queue and waiting for the release reply. Runtime action snapshots
  restore output, settings, queue, selection, and position on failure; after
  release starts, active playback is reported as `Error`, stale generations are
  invalidated, and the restored state is checkpointed. Planning/open failure
  never commits candidate output or settings. New audio actions are held briefly
  while one open result is pending.
- **Files changed:** `app/reborn/src/main.rs`, `app/reborn/src/playback.rs`.
- **Tests added:** Runtime tests inject plan failure after releasing a live fake
  sink, verify no replacement start, and verify single sink ownership on a
  successful replacement. Model recovery tests cover output, queue selection,
  seek position, volume, ReplayGain, and EQ rollback, plus pre-release failure.
  Playback tests inject sink-open failure, a deliberately stalled open actor, a
  full command queue, a disconnected receiver, and a full event queue that
  stalls the actor; they assert the runtime-facing open call returns before the
  actor, no `TrackStarted` occurs on failure, bounded release, and recovery once
  the stalled queue drains. Existing output-switch coverage also verifies that
  the sink actor rejects a second open without release acknowledgement.
- **Tests run:** `cargo fmt --all -- --check`; `cargo check -p reborn --locked`;
  fresh-target `cargo test -p reborn --bin reborn --locked` — 27 passed, 0
  failed after the nonblocking-open correction.
- **Result:** Release/plan/start/commit/fail ordering is explicit and the
  failure-boundary tests pass. The prior logical state is preserved where safe;
  failed active transitions cannot report `Playing` without a sink.
- **Commit:** `72f9995` (`Make sink reconfiguration transactional`).
- **Remaining limitation:** Sink release acknowledgement and ALSA planning
  remain synchronous on the runtime thread; release stays bounded at two
  seconds, including command-queue backpressure. The worker-open acknowledgement
  is polled without blocking the UI loop. Actual BlueALSA and wired-device timing remains
  `PHYSICAL_QUALIFICATION_PENDING`.
- **Evidence tier:** source inspection + fake sink/worker host tests. No physical
  sink was opened.

## R4 — scan identity and pruning safety

**Status: FIXED**

- **Finding and symptom:** A changed file whose FFmpeg metadata open failed was
  counted as a failure but left the per-source `complete` flag true. Finish
  could therefore prune the previous valid row. SD scan safety also used only
  `root.is_dir()`, which remains true when `/media/sd` is an empty unmounted
  directory or a different filesystem has reused that path.
- **Current source confirmation:** `scan_sources()` continued after
  `Decoder::open()` errors without clearing `complete`, and Finish pruned all
  rows whose `seen` token did not match. The old SD completion guard checked
  only directory existence.
- **Implementation:** Decoder-open, metadata, traversal, and directory-entry
  read failures now make the source incomplete; any such incomplete scan skips
  pruning. SD `Source` snapshots carry the observed mount ID in addition to the
  UUID-backed source ID. The scanner verifies the same mount ID at traversal
  boundaries and again in the database writer immediately before Finish.
  Traversal uses an open directory descriptor through `/proc/self/fd`, so a
  replaced path cannot redirect the in-flight walk to a different filesystem.
  Missing UUID or mount identity fails closed. Finish reports whether pruning
  actually occurred; batch, finish, and storage-full errors propagate without
  marking the scan complete.
- **Files changed:** `crates/reborn-core/src/lib.rs`,
  `crates/reborn-library/src/lib.rs`, `crates/reborn-platform/src/storage.rs`,
  `app/reborn/src/main.rs`, `app/reborn/src/bin/reborn-preview.rs`.
- **Tests added:** Changed-file FFmpeg open failure retains the old row; an SD
  path that is unmounted or reused with a new mount ID is rejected; mid-scan
  identity loss and a database-writer identity recheck disable pruning; a safe
  complete scan still prunes. SQLite trigger fault injection covers batch
  failure, finish failure, and a simulated `SQLITE_FULL`/ENOSPC message; all
  preserve prior rows. Mountinfo parsing preserves mount IDs and escaped paths.
- **Tests run:** `cargo fmt --all -- --check`; `cargo check --workspace --locked`;
  `cargo test -p reborn-library -p reborn-platform -p reborn-core --locked` —
  49 passed, 0 failed.
- **Result:** A scan is prune-safe only after traversal, file metadata, stable
  source identity, batch persistence, and finish persistence all succeed.
- **Commit:** `6e8ea74` (`Prevent unsafe library scan pruning`).
- **Remaining limitation:** Unclassified decoder-open failures are treated as
  unsafe even if a file is permanently corrupt; row removal waits for a later
  identity-consistent successful scan. `/proc/self/mountinfo` and a usable
  filesystem UUID are required for SD pruning. Physical media removal and card
  replacement remain `PHYSICAL_QUALIFICATION_PENDING`.
- **Evidence tier:** source inspection + SQLite/file fault injection + host
  mountinfo parser tests. No SD card or physical Y2 was accessed.

## R5 — database recovery classification

**Status: FIXED**

- **Finding and symptom:** Startup treated nearly every SQLite open/setup error
  as corruption, moved the live database first, then moved `-wal` and `-shm`
  independently. A future schema, lock, read-only filesystem, or full disk
  could detach a valid database; a sidecar rename failure could leave a split
  database set.
- **Current source confirmation:** `Database::spawn()` previously quarantined
  any non-future-schema open error, while `open()` returned untyped strings and
  enabled WAL before checking the schema version.
- **Implementation:** SQLite failures are classified by primary/extended error
  code and operation stage into corruption, future schema, busy/locked,
  read-only, full disk, permission, I/O, WAL/SHM, migration, or setup failures.
  The schema version is read before changing journal mode. Only SQLite
  `CORRUPT`/`NOTADB` or a failed `quick_check(10)` reaches quarantine; all
  operational and newer-schema cases preserve the source DB and fail startup.
  Corruption recovery moves the DB and existing sidecars into one evidence
  directory. Rename failures roll back in reverse order. An `INCOMPLETE`
  marker lets the next startup restore a set left mid-transaction by process
  interruption before attempting SQLite open.
- **Files changed:** `crates/reborn-library/src/lib.rs`.
- **Tests added:** Bad-header and damaged-page databases quarantine and rebuild;
  future schema remains intact; locked, read-only, disk-full, permission,
  generic I/O, WAL/SHM, and migration failures retain their distinct class.
  Sidecar-set success, injected WAL/SHM rename failures with full rollback, and
  interrupted-quarantine recovery are exercised at the filesystem boundary.
- **Tests run:** `cargo fmt --all`; `cargo test -p reborn-library --locked` —
  23 passed, 0 failed. Workspace/package check follows with the host gate.
- **Result:** Only genuine corruption is quarantined; newer and operational
  failures preserve the existing DB, and sidecar handling has rollback plus a
  startup recovery path.
- **Commit:** `d61e6fe` (`Classify database recovery failures safely`).
- **Remaining limitation:** The startup integrity probe reads the SQLite
  database and busy handling may wait up to two seconds. Host fixtures verify
  classification and recovery; target filesystem behavior remains
  `PHYSICAL_QUALIFICATION_PENDING`.
- **Evidence tier:** source inspection + SQLite fault injection + temporary
  filesystem tests. No Y2 storage was accessed.

## R6 — crossfade input-window recovery

**Status: FIXED**

- **Finding and symptom:** `read_window()` consumed several next-track decoder
  blocks into a local vector. If a later decoder read failed, `?` returned the
  error and dropped that local prefix even though the decoder had advanced.
- **Current source confirmation:** The previous helper returned
  `Result<Option<Pcm>, String>` and did not return accumulated PCM on error.
- **Implementation:** Window failures now carry both the error and any PCM
  already consumed. The transition recovery drains the old-track suffix first,
  then queues the consumed next-track prefix before the authoritative boundary;
  subsequent decoder reads continue after that prefix. The existing
  `send_stream()` chunking remains the sink write boundary.
- **Files changed:** `app/reborn/src/playback.rs`.
- **Tests added:** Injected failure before input, after the first block, after
  multiple blocks, and one frame short of 5-, 10-, and 15-second windows, with
  sample-by-sample continuity checks. A recovery-order test verifies the old
  suffix precedes the new prefix, and a large partial-prefix case verifies
  every sink chunk stays at or below 524,288 bytes without losing samples.
- **Tests run:** `cargo fmt --all`; `cargo test -p reborn --bin reborn --locked
  playback::tests` — 13 passed, 0 failed.
- **Result:** Every consumed input frame has an owner after a later read error;
  the old suffix and next prefix remain ordered and sink writes stay bounded.
- **Commit:** `48ddaaa` (`Preserve crossfade input after read errors`).
- **Remaining limitation:** Fault injection exercises the real window assembly
  and stream chunker with deterministic PCM; physical 5/10/15-second playback
  remains `PHYSICAL_QUALIFICATION_PENDING`.
- **Evidence tier:** source inspection + runtime helper fault injection + host
  playback tests. No physical output was used.

## R7 — filtered single-track context actions

**Status: FIXED**

- **Finding and symptom:** In a filtered view, context-menu Play could start the
  selected track plus the rest of the filtered collection, while Play Next and
  Add to Queue enqueued every filter match.
- **Current source confirmation:** The context handler routed Play through the
  collection-aware `play_effect()` and special-cased filtered queue actions to
  `PlayNextCollection`/`AddToQueueCollection`.
- **Implementation:** Context rows are resolved against the focused source row.
  A `track:*` row exposes single-track actions; Play emits `Play(index)`, and
  Play Next/Add emit their single-index effects regardless of active album,
  artist, or folder filter. Explicit Album collection rows still emit
  collection effects. Album/artist collection context actions retain their
  collection semantics.
- **Files changed:** `crates/reborn-ui/src/lib.rs`,
  `crates/reborn-ui/src/screens.rs`.
- **Tests added:** Album screen, artist screen, and folder-filtered tracks each
  select the second matching track and verify Play, Play Next, and Add affect
  only that track. Explicit album Play, Play Next, and Add continue to target
  both album members.
- **Tests run:** `cargo fmt --all`; `cargo test -p reborn-ui --locked` — 12
  passed, 0 failed.
- **Result:** Context action intent stays on the selected queue candidate while
  explicit collection actions remain collection-wide.
- **Commit:** `ae4ce7b` (`Keep filtered track actions singular`).
- **Remaining limitation:** Verification is at the UI Action/Effect boundary;
  actual queue mutation and physical button interaction remain
  `PHYSICAL_QUALIFICATION_PENDING`.
- **Evidence tier:** source inspection + host UI action tests.

## R8 — cancel actions after input loss

**Status: FIXED**

- **Finding and symptom:** `SYN_DROPPED` and descriptor loss synthesized
  `Release`, which the action router treated as Select, Next/Previous,
  Play/Pause, or Power activation.
- **Current source confirmation:** `InputManager::release_stale_inputs()`
  emitted `NormalizedInput::Release` on loss, and the router mapped confirmed
  releases directly to actions. It also accepted unmatched release/repeat
  events.
- **Implementation:** Added an explicit `Cancel` normalized event. State loss
  cancels held controls and clears timing/long/repeat state; unmatched release
  and repeat records cancel rather than activate. For `SYN_DROPPED`, the input
  manager discards all events through that device's next `SYN_REPORT`. It does
  not attempt an unsafe key-state ioctl through the existing abstraction and
  remains fail-safe until a new press is observed. Device paths are reopened by
  matching the canonical sysfs device identity and name, and missing devices
  are rediscovered on subsequent polls.
- **Files changed:** `crates/reborn-core/src/lib.rs`,
  `crates/reborn-platform/src/input.rs`.
- **Tests added:** Held Select, Next, and Power followed by `SYN_DROPPED`; stale
  events through `SYN_REPORT`; unmatched release/repeat after reconnect;
  device disappearance before release; cancellation of long/repeat router
  state; and event-node replacement with the same physical identity versus a
  reused node with a different identity.
- **Tests run:** `cargo fmt --all -- --check`; `cargo test -p reborn-platform
  --locked` — 28 passed, 0 failed.
- **Result:** Input loss cannot synthesize an activation-sensitive command;
  current key state remains unknown and therefore canceled until a fresh press.
- **Commit:** `d592203` (`Cancel activation after input state loss`).
- **Remaining limitation:** No current key-state ioctl resynchronization is
  attempted; loss of state requires a release then a new press before that key
  can activate. `SYN_DROPPED` behavior follows the [Linux kernel evdev event
  protocol](https://docs.kernel.org/input/event-codes.html). Hardware button
  behavior remains `PHYSICAL_QUALIFICATION_PENDING`.
- **Evidence tier:** source inspection + deterministic event-stream tests +
  official Linux kernel documentation. No input device was opened on the Y2.

## R9A — artwork occurrence and presentation order

**Status: FIXED**

- **Finding and symptom:** Artwork used a separate event queue from playback
  boundaries and only carried `TrackId`. The same track queued twice could
  receive art before the second occurrence became current, then reject and
  lose that art permanently.
- **Current source confirmation:** The decoder sent artwork directly through
  the UI event queue while audio boundaries crossed the sink stream; the UI
  matched only generation and track ID.
- **Implementation:** Artwork now travels through the bounded audio stream
  after its authoritative boundary and uses the same playback event sender.
  Events carry `QueueEntryId`; the UI accepts art only for the current queue
  occurrence and clears presentation state at a boundary.
- **Files changed:** `app/reborn/src/playback.rs`, `app/reborn/src/main.rs`.
- **Tests added:** Duplicate `TrackId` occurrences reject next-entry art before
  the boundary and accept it after; the playback event channel preserves
  boundary-before-art order.
- **Tests run:** `cargo test -p reborn --bin reborn --locked
  artwork_presentation_tests`; `cargo test -p reborn --bin reborn --locked
  boundary_event_precedes_its_queue_entry_artwork` — both passed.
- **Result:** Queue occurrence, not only track identity, controls artwork
  presentation timing.
- **Commit:** `ed645c8` (`Bind artwork to queue entry boundaries`).
- **Remaining limitation:** Renderer/art decoding behavior has host evidence;
  display presentation remains `PHYSICAL_QUALIFICATION_PENDING`.
- **Evidence tier:** source inspection + targeted host runtime/event tests.

## R9B — Bluetooth transport epoch and open contract

**Status: PARTIAL**

- **Finding and symptom:** Transport identity was only a hash of the PCM object
  path. An object reused after daemon restart or renegotiation could leave a
  stale typed sink plan active; the `bluealsa:` ALSA `plug` endpoint can also
  hide conversion from the application.
- **Current source confirmation:** `pcm_generation()` depended only on the
  path. `AlsaSink::open_spec()` previously did not compare the actual opened
  rate, format, channels, or device with the plan.
- **Implementation:** Transport epochs now change on a daemon owner event,
  object removal/recreation (including same path), or any observed contract
  property change (Device, Transport, Mode, Codec, Format, Rate, Channels).
  Epoch IDs are process-wide so a Bluetooth worker restart cannot reuse a
  previous worker's values. The required D-Bus matches are registered with the
  bus; if a required match cannot be installed, Bluetooth PCM observations are
  withheld. `SinkSpec` records the object/device/transport/mode/codec and epoch,
  validates the selected peer and negotiated format/rate/channels, and open
  checks the actual ALSA application-side parameters against the plan. Runtime
  reloads an active sink for a newly observed epoch and stops truthfully if its
  selected PCM disappears.
- **Files changed:** `crates/reborn-platform/src/bluetooth.rs`,
  `crates/reborn-audio/src/lib.rs`, `crates/reborn-audio/src/native.rs`,
  `app/reborn/src/main.rs`.
- **Tests added:** Fake private D-Bus property change and same-path
  remove/recreate; epoch invalidation for owner changes and each contract
  property; non-reuse across a worker restart; SinkSpec stale generation,
  wrong peer and changed-property rejection; runtime changed/unavailable epoch
  behavior.
- **Tests run:** `cargo test -p reborn-audio --locked` — 5 passed;
  `cargo test -p reborn-platform --locked bluetooth::tests` — 7 passed;
  `cargo test -p reborn --bin reborn --locked bluetooth_epoch_tests` — 1
  passed; `cargo check -p reborn --locked` passed.
- **Result:** Stale object-path-only identity is removed and the application-side
  ALSA plan/open contract is checked; loss or change invalidates the active
  sink.
- **Commit:** `246dc41` (`Invalidate stale Bluetooth transport plans`).
- **Remaining limitation:** `bluealsa:` is an ALSA `plug` wrapper, so the app
  can verify the ALSA-facing contract but cannot prove the underlying
  BlueALSA PCM is bit-precise without a private/raw interface. The software
  deliberately makes no bit-precision claim. SBC remains the active codec;
  physical transport qualification is `PHYSICAL_QUALIFICATION_PENDING`.
- **Evidence tier:** source inspection + targeted host Rust tests + private
  fake-D-Bus lifecycle/property test. No BlueALSA service or Y2 was accessed.

## R10 — build, version, and manifest truth

**Status: PARTIAL**

- **Finding and symptom:** Reborn's product label and ARM checker still
  reported FFmpeg 9.0.1 / SONAMEs `.101` despite the pinned target being 9.0.2
  / `.102`. Y2Linux's current package producer and validator still described
  `Y2PlayerNative`, `implemented=false`, and `/usr/bin/y2player`, although the
  rootfs installs Reborn.
- **Current source confirmation:** `reborn-media` hard-coded 9.0.1;
  `tools/build/qemu-check.py` asserted 9.0.1 and `.101`; the package producer
  emitted and validator required the obsolete application fields. FFmpeg source
  acquisition required the archive to be pre-seeded.
- **Implementation:** Added a single Reborn `FFMPEG_VERSION` source used by
  runtime reporting, QEMU verification, fixtures, and Y2Linux's pinned source
  acquisition. The locked build runner now binds the paired Reborn source and
  forwards the production artifact directory and paired source path, plus the
  hash-validated owner-firmware input required by the production post-build
  step. The ARM
  checker now checks the final loaded runtime and `.102` SONAMEs. The
  production application receipt names Reborn's actual binaries,
  shared media library and `/data/reborn` state; rootfs and manifest validation
  verify those files and reject `/usr/bin/y2player`. Boot-only/system-update
  receipts preserve or update the installed application identity correctly.
  When a legacy base lacks a Reborn version field, its retained version is
  resolved from the exact recorded Reborn source commit; packaging refuses a
  retained rootfs whose application identity cannot be established. Local
  review documents remain untracked and are excluded from candidate clean-source
  checks.
  FFmpeg acquisition now downloads the official pinned archive to a temporary
  file, verifies the existing exact SHA256, then atomically installs it. The
  test harness documents production, retained profile/source-boundary, and host
  prerequisite classes without deleting historical tests.
- **Files changed:** Reborn `FFMPEG_VERSION`, `crates/reborn-media/src/native.rs`,
  `tools/build/qemu-check.py`, `tools/build/fixtures.py`, fixture manifest,
  current media/dependency docs; Y2Linux production version/package/validator
  tooling and locked runner, retained source-version resolution, FFmpeg
  acquisition, Buildroot's paired source mount, production tests and
  test-profile documentation.
- **Tests added:** Workspace-version and Reborn application receipt checks;
  exact retained source-commit version resolution; rejection of unverifiable
  identity and the stale legacy receipt; verified archive acquisition and
  checksum-failure cleanup; Reborn root-image path/legacy-binary checks.
- **Tests run:** `cargo fmt --all -- --check`; `cargo test -p reborn-media
  --locked` — 20 passed; Y2Linux `tests.test_reborn_receipts`,
  `tests.test_production_handover`, `tests.test_production_storage` — 26
  passed before root-image boundary tests; updated suite now passes 30 tests;
  changed Python modules compiled; the locked build runner smoke test verified
  its `/build`, `/tmp/Y2Reborn`, and validated owner-firmware mappings; the
  cached FFmpeg 9.0.2 archive matched its pinned SHA256. Fresh final-gate
  results will follow.
- **Result:** Source-level version and product receipts agree with the intended
  current artifacts; package/build gates remain to be run on the fresh final
  candidate.
- **Commit:** Reborn pending; Y2Linux pending.
- **Remaining limitation:** Target FFmpeg 9.0.2 and package identity still need
  fresh ARM/QEMU and rootfs/package validation. Historical baseline documents
  and fixture-generator provenance continue to name FFmpeg 9.0.1 where that is
  the version actually tested/generated. No hardware was accessed.
- **Evidence tier:** source inspection + targeted host tests + exact local
  archive hash verification; ARM/package evidence pending.
