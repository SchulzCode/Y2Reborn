# Reborn UI reset 01

This is the presentation-layer reset for the supplied Reborn Y2 UI
Implementation Pack. It keeps the existing playback, media, library, storage,
radio, power, persistence, diagnostics, and service architecture. Y2Linux was
not modified.

## Source and artifacts

- implementation commits: `bd28e10` (reset), `c2ab6cb` (final wired-control audit)
- recoverable pre-reset checkpoint: `0a104dd`
- ARM target: `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf`, Cortex-A7 hard-float
- production SDK used: `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/y2linux-reborn-audio-final/buildroot`
- production bundle: `out/reborn-ui-reset-01/`
- checksum file: `out/reborn-ui-reset-01/SHA256SUMS`

The stripped ARM candidate binaries are:

| File | Bytes | SHA-256 |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `armv7/release/reborn` | 2,448,588 | `2b71f4418edf65233a87fb51628446ae54f8d3618c13364ef6fd86431acdf168` |
| `armv7/release/rebornctl` | 445,532 | `77d5e93e53d89fe46f000c3b1f54eb09f445db0bcd516cc908de9753926b6f18` |

Rollback binaries were built from checkpoint `0a104dd`:

| File | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| `fallback/armv7/release/reborn` | `5bc77f2109271fdf6b48c70b24a2d1a02ba06ac3da26b35f9b2086090509d21c` |
| `fallback/armv7/release/rebornctl` | `0ea4ea80f39ff629f2a8c078cc66a5c040e8d304bb1240cb4be691e75db480af` |

The bundle contains eight deterministic 480x360 PNG previews and a manifest.
No Y2ROOT image was produced because normal UI logic belongs in Y2Reborn and
Y2Linux was intentionally left unchanged. QEMU runtime qualification was not
run because `qemu-arm` is not installed on this host; physical installation
and device qualification are pending owner action.

## Manual SSH installation

This is a userspace replacement only. Do not flash partitions and do not alter
Y2DATA. Use the existing owner SSH workflow and substitute its approved host,
known-hosts file, and identity below:

```sh
cd /home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Reborn/out/reborn-ui-reset-01
(cd . && sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS)

scp armv7/release/reborn <owner-host>:/tmp/reborn.ui-reset-01
scp armv7/release/rebornctl <owner-host>:/tmp/rebornctl.ui-reset-01

ssh <owner-host> '
  set -eu
  test "$(sha256sum /tmp/reborn.ui-reset-01 | cut -d" " -f1)" = 609329f4a932b5c6ee360392756a93de7e5cf0f82b396c8fb65cecd42314d6cc
  test "$(sha256sum /tmp/rebornctl.ui-reset-01 | cut -d" " -f1)" = 77d5e93e53d89fe46f000c3b1f54eb09f445db0bcd516cc908de9753926b6f18
  /etc/init.d/S05reborn stop
  cp -p /usr/bin/reborn /data/reborn/state/reborn.pre-ui-reset
  cp -p /usr/bin/rebornctl /data/reborn/state/rebornctl.pre-ui-reset
  install -m 0755 /tmp/reborn.ui-reset-01 /usr/bin/reborn.ui-reset-01
  install -m 0755 /tmp/rebornctl.ui-reset-01 /usr/bin/rebornctl.ui-reset-01
  mv -f /usr/bin/reborn.ui-reset-01 /usr/bin/reborn
  mv -f /usr/bin/rebornctl.ui-reset-01 /usr/bin/rebornctl
  /etc/init.d/S05reborn start
  rebornctl status --json
'
```

If the health check fails, stop Reborn, restore the two backups from
`/data/reborn/state/` to `/usr/bin/reborn` and `/usr/bin/rebornctl`, then run
`/etc/init.d/S05reborn start`. The fallback binaries in this bundle are also
available for a controlled rollback. No private SSH key is part of the bundle.
