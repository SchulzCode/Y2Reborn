## Ownership and boot order

The early splash (Y2Linux `tools/graphics/reborn-splash.c`, started from the
initramfs) owns the display from early boot until Reborn has rendered its
**first complete UI frame**. Reborn starts **last** (`S90reborn`), after the
platform services, the system bus and, when the user has them enabled, the
radios are up (`/usr/libexec/y2/boot-gate`, bounded to 45 s, never a fixed
delay). So the first frame is a complete system: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, audio and
the library workers exist when the user first sees and can touch the UI. The
sequence is:

1. The splash shows the Reborn wordmark, one thin white bar and a short status
   line. The bar fills left to right to coarse positions of real milestones.
2. Reborn finishes starting, then renders the real Home frame with the full boot
   screen over it (`reborn_ui::boot_transition`, remaining = 1). The bar is
   already full and the status is "Starting Reborn" (milestone `ready`).
3. Reborn sends `READY 1`. The splash completes bar and status if they are not
   already there, drops DRM master and replies `RELEASED 1`. There is no timer.
4. Reborn takes master, presents that frame, and sends `PRESENTED 1`; the splash
   destroys its buffer and exits. The first presented frame is pixel-identical
   to the splash's last frame.
5. Reborn reveals the UI over `BOOT_FADE_FRAMES` (10) frames, ≈0.34 s: the bar
   and status line fade out first, then the wordmark lifts a few pixels and
   dissolves with the cover on an ease-in-out curve. Input is ignored until the
   UI is fully visible. `application_ready` is announced after the first frame
   is presented, not before.

## Why the logo used to stay up

Reborn handed off as soon as its renderer existed (`graphics_ready`) and
presented `boot_frame()`, a static copy of the logo. It then ran the rest of
startup on its render thread (media sources, database and scanner, audio,
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth workers, control server, diagnostics, platform client,
artwork, AVRCP) and only drew again when that loop began. The splash was gone,
so nothing animated and the logo stayed for the whole remainder of startup;
the dissolve started only afterwards, and `application_ready` was announced for
the logo frame. Reborn also used to start before the radios and the system bus
existed (`S05reborn`), so its first frames were an incomplete system.

## Milestones

Producers write a milestone name to `/run/reborn-splash/phase`: the initramfs
through `y2_stage` (its existing stage names), `rcS` before each service that
matters (`rc_*`), `boot-gate` for each real wait, and Reborn through
`startup_phase` (`reborn_platform::contract::boot_milestone`). The table lives
in `reborn_ui::BOOT_PHASES`; `reborn-preview` exports it with the rendered
text to `docs/ui/previews/v2/boot-layout.json`, and Y2Linux
`tools/graphics/make-splash-mark.py` generates `reborn-splash-mark.h` from it.

| Milestones | Status line |
| --- | --- |
| `start`, `root_data_mounted`, `switch_root`, `rc_data` | Starting system |
| `storage_discovery` … `fsck_complete` | Preparing storage |
| `rc_time` | Setting the clock |
| `rc_power` | Starting power |
| `rc_bluetooth` | Starting Bluetooth |
| `rc_connectivity` … `conn_activated` | Starting connectivity (factory records, calibration, radio activation) |
| `conn_wifi_wait`, `conn_wifi` | Starting Wi-Fi (only when enabled) |
| `conn_bluetooth_wait`, `conn_bluetooth` | Starting Bluetooth (only when enabled) |
| `system_ready`, `model_restored` | Starting Reborn |
| `graphics_ready`, `storage_ready` | Loading music library |
| `library_workers_ready`, `core_services_ready` | Starting audio |
| `audio_ready` | Starting connectivity (Reborn's radio workers) |
| `radio_workers_ready` … `ready` | Starting Reborn |

The positions are ordinal weights, not time or work estimates, and are never
shown as numbers. The bar only moves forward: earlier or unknown names are
ignored, a missing milestone (a disabled radio) leaves the bar where it is until
a later one arrives, and nothing advances on a timer. The splash redraws only
while the bar is gliding to a new position (33 ms ticks) and is otherwise asleep
in `poll`. `rcS` also writes every script's start and end uptime to
`/run/y2/boot-trace.jsonl` for profiling.

The initramfs `rescue` stage and a failed hand-off show "Could not start /
Restart the player" without a bar. The failure timeout counts from the last
milestone (60 s), so a slow but progressing boot is never called a failure. A
late `READY` still works.

## Early-boot waits that were removed

* The initramfs credits the device's stored random seed as soon as Y2DATA is
  mounted. Before, the kernel needed ~6 s to gather entropy on this CPU and the
  first process that waited for randomness (the platform helper's temporary
  file names) blocked until then, about 3 s with nothing booting.
* `y2-platform` records no longer use `tempfile`, so they never wait for the
  random pool.
* Storage discovery polls every 50 ms instead of once a second.

## Shutdown

Reborn dissolves the UI into the same screen with a full bar and **Saving**,
saves (audio, session, database), then shows **Shutting down** (or
**Restarting**, **Battery empty**) while the bar drains right to left and the
screen dims. It presents a black frame, waits one refresh, turns the backlight
off and acknowledges. It does not invent progress: the two labels are the two
real phases. If Reborn never acknowledges (hang, crash, deadline), the platform
turns the backlight off *before* stopping Reborn, so restoring the fbdev buffer
cannot show on a lit panel.

## Checks

- `cargo test -p reborn-ui` (phase table, bar geometry, no accent colour, fade
  and shutdown schedules) and `cargo test -p reborn --test boot_handoff_guard`
  (first frame is the real UI under the cover, readiness after presentation).
- Y2Linux `tests/test_reborn_splash.py` (milestone mapping, no regression,
  missing/failed milestones, pixel identity with Reborn, hand-off timing, idle
  without wake-ups) and `tests/test_platform_power_contract.py`.
- Previews: `docs/ui/previews/boot/contact-sheet.png`, made by Y2Linux
  `tools/graphics/boot-previews.py`.
