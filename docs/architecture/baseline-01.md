# Reborn Baseline 01 architecture and operator contract

Reborn is a native Linux application. Platform entry: Y2Linux `16b2fb8`, retained
GPU-01 graphics/audio evidence, then owner-confirmed and pinned-SSH-observed
GPU-02 (`6.18.0-y2linux-gpu-02`, root `Y2LINUX-GPU-02`). The read-only capture is
[platform-entry.txt](../validation/evidence/platform-entry.txt). No Reborn binary
has been installed by the assistant. GPU-02 deep suspend, Wi-Fi association and
Bluetooth peer/audio qualification remain physical gates.

Rust **1.90.0**; target **armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf**, Cortex-A7.
Production linker is Buildroot's `host/bin/arm-linux-gcc` (**GCC 13.3.0**), sysroot
queried from that compiler. `tools/build/cross.sh` sets target CC/AR/linker and
pkg-config sysroot; it invokes locked, offline Cargo. All 53 external locked
packages, including inactive host/Windows support crates, are vendored. The
[full version/license inventory](dependencies.json) records every package.
Direct Rust dependencies: serde/serde_json, libc, rusqlite, dbus, font8x8,
flate2/tar; cc/pkg-config are build dependencies. No async runtime or bindgen.

Production FFmpeg **9.0.1**, SQLite **3.50.4**, Mesa **24.0.9**, libdrm **2.4.124**
come from Buildroot **2025.02.17**. The media contract and selected component
families are documented in [the FFmpeg 9 audio-stack design](reborn-audio-stack-ffmpeg9.md):
local music demuxers/decoders, FLTP libavfilter processing, libswresample,
JPEG/PNG/WebP artwork and no FFmpeg executable, encoder or network protocol.
Original synthesized fixtures carry CC0 provenance and hashes. Native libraries
retain their Buildroot license/source receipts; Rust vendors retain upstream
licenses. The graphics lifetime code is adapted from Y2Linux's MIT gpu-check.

The player ELF has no direct `libav*` `DT_NEEDED` entries. Buildroot packages
the single `libreborn_media.so` membrane under `/usr/lib/reborn`, which is
loaded on first media use. Reborn starts after `S02y2-data`; radio and network
workers retry independently while their providers start later. The GPU context
is opened before the library scan, but KMS ownership remains with the early
splash until Reborn presents its first complete frame. Startup phase events
cover model restore, graphics, storage, library workers, core services, radio
workers and runtime readiness.

## Threading, playback, storage and UI

The UI thread alone owns the application state. Fixed workers: playback, audio,
scanner, database, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, diagnostics, control, logger, watchdog.
Channels are bounded: playback 4, audio commands 8, PCM 8 blocks, playback events
64, database 32, scanner requests 1/results 2, radio requests 8/results 2,
diagnostics 2, control requests 8, logger 256. Cancellation/generation atomics
and observability locks are coordination only, not shared application authority.
FFmpeg contexts use one decoder thread. ALSA writes are nonblocking, with at most
20 ms waits; stale generations are discarded on stop, pause, seek and output
switch. Pause releases the sink; resume decodes from the last measured position.
Wired playback prefers S32_LE at the source-native qualified rate, while the
current qualification profile deliberately selects the physically proven 44.1
kHz stereo S16 mode. Bluetooth consumes the same processed PCM stream and
adapts at its final BlueALSA sink boundary; discovery uses the
4.3.1 ObjectManager API. A missing or unsupported PCM fails before output changes.
Eight 2048-frame blocks bound decoder buffering to about 372 ms plus the sink.
The native resampler staging buffer is bounded separately. EOF drains pending
PCM; a stalled sink reports an error rather than blocking the UI.

Wired ALSA is discovered by card identity **Y2Audio**, not card number. The sink
negotiates the qualified stereo format/rate from the platform profile, logs any
explicit fallback, and rejects an unqualified combination. It saves/restores
Master/Headphone mixer state, uses the proven -24 dB hardware level and keeps
software volume inside the FFmpeg filter graph. BlueALSA uses validated
peer addresses with PROFILE=a2dp; BlueZ and BlueALSA own transport/codecs/keys.
Opening an audio sink holds the platform's shared `/run/y2/activity.lock`;
closing it releases the suspend lease. This prevents the existing explicit
suspend helper from interrupting playback. Screen blanking does not suspend.

Internal music defaults to `/data/music`; Reborn refuses normal startup without
mounted Y2DATA schema 1. SD mounting uses the existing bounded `y2-media` helper
and its unique ext4/vfat/SD-controller selection. Mount entries and libblkid UUID
identify sources. Removal pauses affected playback, marks source entries offline,
and retains their database records. Reinsertion triggers an incremental scan.
No block-number assumptions, formatting, Y2ROOT music writes, or protected reads.

SQLite user_version **1**, foreign keys, WAL, NORMAL synchronization and 2-second
busy timeout. `sources` stores identity/root/online. `tracks` stores all requested
file and metadata fields, a unique (source_id,path), scan marker and deletion flag.
A single DB worker owns the connection. Scanner batches 64 writes in transactions;
(size,mtime) reuse skips FFmpeg. Missing files are marked deleted only after a
complete mounted-source traversal. Traversal errors retain records; bad media
is skipped. Symlinks are not traversed; depth <=32 and <=250,000 files per scan.
UI lists/queues currently cap at 20,000 tracks; a paged DB query API is available.

Artwork is extracted only when opening a selected track, reduced to 160x160 RGBA,
and cached under a track/size/mtime identity. At most 64 cache files (6.25 MiB).
The GPU texture is reused; no frame-time artwork decode. Missing/invalid artwork
gets the built-in Reborn tile. The UI uses a public-domain bitmap glyph atlas;
non-ASCII glyphs currently display `?`. This is a known baseline limitation.

DRM driver identity selects Mediatek KMS; connected connector/preferred mode is
queried. Linear XRGB8888 GBM scanout, EGL ES2 config, GLES textured rectangles,
alpha blending, font/art textures and page flips follow the physically proven
Lima path. A non-Mali400 renderer is rejected. Static screens stop submissions;
damage is capped at ~29.4 FPS (34 ms). Now Playing updates once per elapsed second.
Page flips have a 3-second deadline. Context failure captures evidence and makes
one recreation attempt; hardware resume correctness remains to be qualified.

Evdev nodes are discovered by the four proven device names; node numbers are
never fixed. Standard Linux KEY_UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT/ENTER/BACK/MENU, media/volume/
Power and REL_WHEEL map to Actions; release events do not activate UI actions.
All main screens work from buttons/wheel. Now Playing: Select toggles, Left/Right
seek 10 seconds, Up/Down previous/next. Menu returns home, Back returns one level.
WPA2 entry: wheel chooses a character, Select/Right appends, Left deletes, Menu
submits, Back cancels. Text is masked. Saved networks connect with Select and
forget with Left. Bluetooth device pages offer Pair/Connect/Disconnect/Forget/
Use for audio. Pair confirmation uses Select/Back; legacy PIN-entry peers are
explicitly rejected by the baseline DisplayYesNo agent.

Wi-Fi uses native Unix datagram wpa_supplicant control plus standard rfkill;
DHCP remains with the existing Y2Linux connectivity service. No wpa_cli backend.
Passwords are sent only to wpa_supplicant, never stored in Reborn DB/state or
logged. BlueZ uses system D-Bus ObjectManager, Adapter1, Device1, AgentManager1/
Agent1. Pair/connect requests are asynchronous on the agent connection with
bounded pending operations and deadlines. BlueALSA ObjectManager/PCM1 exposes
available PCM/rate/codec state. No bluetoothctl application backend. The live
GPU-02 service accepted the read-only ObjectManager query; no peer was connected.

`power_supply` and backlight are discovered under sysfs. Idle screen timeout is
60 seconds by default, adjustable 30..600. Screen-off leaves playback running;
input wakes without accidentally activating the underlying selection. Reborn
does not initiate deep suspend, reboot, charging changes or radio-pair tests
from baseline qualification. Offline charging remains in the platform initramfs.

## FFI boundary and persistence

Application, UI, control, library and observability logic forbid unsafe Rust.
Reviewed owned native wrappers are `reborn-media/src/native.rs` + `native/media.c`,
`reborn-audio/src/native.rs` + `native/audio.c`, `reborn-graphics/src/native.rs` +
`native/graphics.c`, and the small `reborn-platform/src/native.rs` POSIX/libblkid
wrapper. Every Rust unsafe block documents lifetime/ownership. Native contexts
are !Send and thread-confined; only the separately allocated C11 atomic cancel
handle is Send+Sync through Arc. Packet/frame/codec/resampler pointers never
leave reborn-media. rusqlite and dbus supply their own narrow maintained FFI.

Mutable layout, mode 0700 directories and 0600 state/log/bundle files:

```
/data/reborn/library.db (+ WAL/SHM)
/data/reborn/state/session.json
/data/reborn/cache/*.rgba
/data/reborn/logs/{reborn-current,reborn-previous-1,reborn-previous-2}.jsonl
/data/reborn/logs/{panic-last.json,startup-last.jsonl,supervisor-last.json}
/data/reborn/diagnostics/reborn-diagnostic-*.tar.gz
/run/reborn/control.sock
```

State includes queue, position, source configuration, output, settings and screen.
Atomic temporary-file/fsync/rename/parent-fsync checkpoints occur every 15 seconds,
on pause/output changes and orderly exit. Restore always starts paused/stopped.
The database preserves offline sources. Radio secrets/preferences remain with
the existing platform service stores under Y2DATA.

## Observability and control

JSONL fields: timestamp_wall (Unix ms, device RTC may be unset),
timestamp_monotonic (session ms), boot_id, reborn_session_id, sequence, level,
subsystem, event, message, correlation_id, fields. Stable subsystem tags are
listed in `reborn-observability::SUBSYSTEMS`. Correlation IDs are monotonically
allocated per session and follow playback/scan/radio operations. Native errors
retain readable FFmpeg/ALSA codes; D-Bus errors retain interface/method/error name.
FFmpeg and ALSA callbacks enter the same logger. Repeated identical messages are
limited to ten per ten seconds; dropped counts are metrics. No per-write INFO.

Default INFO; runtime ERROR/WARN/INFO/DEBUG/TRACE per subsystem. Overrides reset
on restart; TRACE expires after 300 seconds. Ring: 512 events, <=4096 bytes each.
Logger queue: 256 events; overflow drops logging, never blocks playback. Rotation:
three files, 1 MiB each (3 MiB total). Disk-full/write failures degrade logging
health and leave the recent-event ring available. Panic evidence replaces one
small file. Diagnostic archives: <=2 MiB uncompressed data, four retained, and
at most one automatic bundle per 300 seconds. Cache/log/bundle limits are independent.

Metrics registry uses a fixed low-cardinality inventory (see source/dependencies
handoff); counters cover playback, decode, audio XRUN/recovery, graphics, scanner,
Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, SD and logger errors; gauges cover buffer frames/ms, query/frame
latency, scan throughput, track count and uptime. No per-track/path/peer labels.
Health states: ok/degraded/failed/unavailable, with required/optional classification,
recent faults and runtime heartbeats. Unavailable optional radios/SD do not fail
the baseline; required graphics/audio/database/storage/input can fail it.
Watchdog checks UI/audio/playback/scanner/DB deadlines without restarting workers.
Panic hook retains version/thread/location/message/event IDs/state summary and
exits 101 for supervision. SIGINT/SIGTERM checkpoint and close graphics/audio.

Protocol: versioned newline-terminated JSON on a local Unix socket; no TCP listener.
Parent 0700/socket 0600, owner/root access. Eight clients maximum; requests <=8192
bytes, responses <=2 MiB, request assembly 2 seconds, bounded response deadlines.
Unknown operations/fields, malformed JSON and oversized requests are rejected.
No exec command, arbitrary file write or free-form backend command exists.

`rebornctl` always emits JSON (`--json` accepted):

- status, health (0 healthy / 1 degraded / 2 failed), metrics, snapshot
- logs [--since 60s] [--subsystem audio] [--level warn] [--last 100] [--follow]
- events [--last 100]; log-level [SUBSYSTEM LEVEL | reset]
- diagnose; test list; scan incremental; input monitor --seconds 1..30
- play ID; pause; resume; stop; next; previous; seek MILLISECONDS; volume 0..100
- output wired|MAC (Bluetooth must already be connected with A2DP/BlueALSA)

Logs/events queries use the bounded live ring, not an unbounded file read.
`logs --follow` polls that live stream. Previous rotated files are available for
owner SSH inspection. Snapshot combines the UI-owned model with worker state,
metrics/health/resources/recent faults. Individual counters may progress during
serialization; it is not a stop-the-world sample.

Safe tests: baseline, decoder, playback (decode-only), database, library, storage,
graphics, input, wifi-scan, wifi-connect --saved ID, bluetooth, bluetooth-scan
--seconds 1..15, audio-wired, audio-bluetooth. Audio tests are explicit and reject
active playback; they output one second of generated -46 dBFS audio at reduced
test gain. Default baseline does not play sound, change radio state, pair, reboot,
suspend or modify personal files. Scan tests restore prior power/discovery state;
connection to a saved network requires that explicit command. Database writes
are rolled back; quick_check and a <=64-track consistency sample are used.

Bundles contain build/session/kernel/boot identity, status/health/metrics, up to
128 recent events, selected recent kernel GPU/audio/storage fault excerpts,
proc memory/process summaries, ALSA cards, storage/mount identity, renderer,
radio state, power supplies and DB/scanner summaries. A recursive sanitizer removes
secret/PSK/link-key/IRK/calibration/private-key fields, pairing prompts, media paths
and private title/artist/album/queue data. Fixed allowlisted sources only: no
credentials, protected partition bytes, factory inputs or arbitrary user files.
The host qualification tool never reads a private SSH key; OpenSSH uses the
existing owner identity and required pinned known-hosts file.

## Validation boundary

Host tests cover state/generation/queue/source loss, sink failure/stop/switch,
SQLite migration/future-schema/ref-counted identity/offline retention/SQL injection,
scanner incremental reuse/deletion/malformed files, six decoder formats/truncation/
cancellation, log rotation/ring/size/redaction/disk-full/storm/metrics/heartbeat,
control validation/JSON/socket permissions/slow clients, UI/navigation and state
restore. An isolated ARM run will exercise the actual FFmpeg 9.0.1/SQLite ELF binaries
and JSON control tests; it does not emulate physical Lima/audio/radios.

Remaining physical gates: visible GPU rendering and physical input, real wired
and Bluetooth audio/XRUN/coexistence, pairing/reconnect/output switching, WPA2/DHCP,
real SD hotplug, screen-off/wake, reboot restore and GPU-02 same-boot deep resume.
Only physical evidence can produce **REBORN BASELINE 01 PASSED**.
