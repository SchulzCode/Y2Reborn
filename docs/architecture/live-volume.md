Volume keys and `rebornctl volume` update an atomic sink-worker target. They do
not invalidate the playback generation, seek, rebuild the FFmpeg filter graph,
or reopen ALSA. This addresses the owner-observed SBC pause and “starting audio”
state on every volume adjustment.

Playback decodes at neutral **user** gain while retaining FFmpeg ReplayGain,
headroom, EQ and the clipping limiter. The sink applies the existing squared
volume curve after those stages, so buffered and crossfaded PCM responds to a
new volume without recovering amplitude from already-muted samples. This changes
limiter interaction: limiting operates before user attenuation, including at low
listening volume. The live `audio_user_volume` metric reports the user target;
FFmpeg's gain metadata describes its own graph and excludes this final gain.

Changes ramp over five milliseconds with one gain per stereo frame. A partial
or zero-frame ALSA write advances the envelope only by accepted frames; retries
use original PCM, avoiding repeated attenuation. Writes process at most 512
frames per iteration. The downstream ALSA/BlueALSA/headset buffering still adds
its normal latency, so this is not a zero-latency remote-volume claim.

Unity gain passes bytes unchanged. S16, sign-extended S24 in 32-bit containers,
and S32 are supported. Gain is rounded and bounded in the negotiated integer
format; no additional output precision is claimed. Volume zero is exact silence.

Tests exercise the real decoder with queued PCM and a partially accepting fake
Bluetooth sink, starting muted then raising/muting/raising volume. They prove
one sink open, one start event, unchanged generation and exact frame count.
Separate waveform tests cover stereo ramp continuity, zero/partial acceptance,
retargeting, signed packing, unity low-bit preservation and exact mute.
Physical volume-key/listening confirmation remains required for a new binary.
