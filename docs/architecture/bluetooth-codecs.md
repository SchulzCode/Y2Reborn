# Bluetooth codecs: current capability audit and proposed Auto policy

**Historical audit/design at its 2026-09-22 revisions.** Later Hardware Final
source/ARM work compiled a private optional-encoder profile and implemented a
gated Auto control, while normal radio launch keeps optional endpoints disabled.
This supersedes the audit's "no source/binary integration" statement **only for
the later candidate**. Fix01 physically demonstrates a bounded CONSYS retry,
not peer codec audio. [Current application state](../CURRENT_REBORN_STATE.md),
[current platform contract](../../../Y2Linux/docs/architecture/platform-bluetooth-v1.md),
and [later codec source work](../../../Y2Linux/docs/validation/Y2-HARDWARE-FINAL-RADIO-AUDIO.md)
separate those scopes. The recommendation below is not implementation authority.

Date: 2026-09-22. Scope: Y2Linux and Y2Reborn as one product.

**Status: AUDIT / DESIGN ONLY. No codec enabled, production code changed, image
built, device accessed, or device flashed during this review. Auto is a proposal,
not an implemented feature.** Material physical and distribution uncertainties
trigger the user's stop condition for implementation.

Audited revisions:

* Y2Linux: `be7e64c5dd5c6bdfe39c35e8fbd70e6b4b2c4717`.
* Y2Reborn: `011884b7ef13187171225f252c213afeeb6da851`.

The existing broad [system audit](../audit/current-system/01_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md)
remains relevant. This focused review additionally inspected the retained raw
HCI feature/version/buffer-size responses, version-specific BlueALSA/BlueZ
source, generated configuration, linked dependencies and current upstream
codec/licensing sources. [Evidence, executed checks and qualification plan](../audit/bluetooth-codecs/2026-09-22-evidence-and-tests.md)
give reproducible inspection locations and explicitly unexecuted test cases.

## 1. Decision

Keep the native Linux HCI + BlueZ + BlueALSA architecture and the single Reborn
decode/DSP pipeline. Do not replace it with another audio server or put codec
encoders in Reborn.

The current image provides **SBC only**, with BlueALSA's normal high-quality SBC
setting. It does not provide AAC, aptX, aptX HD or LDAC A2DP encoding. Even SBC
headphone playback is **not physically qualified by the retained evidence**.
Adapter bring-up and discovery are different achievements.

Recommended initial release codec set: **SBC, including ordinary high-quality
operation and a conservative fallback**. This is a recommendation after
qualification, not permission to label today's Bluetooth production-ready.
Next candidates: AAC, aptX/aptX HD and LDAC, individually gated by library
provenance/licensing, target builds, CPU budget, interoperability and coexistence.
SBC XQ is useful to investigate; it is not a separate codec or an unconditional
safe fallback. LDAC 990/909 kbps and 88.2/96-kHz operation stay experimental.

Five findings determine the next work:

1. Establish fresh-bond SBC playback, reconnect and sustained Wi-Fi coexistence
   on this Y2 before claiming a multi-codec product.
2. Add truthful typed capability/negotiated-format observation before selection.
   Today's adapter ignores BlueALSA `Format` and requests S16 for Bluetooth.
3. Keep one connection-retry owner. The existing platform reconnect helper
   requires `Trusted`, which Reborn's pairing path does not establish.
4. Resolve distribution gates. Radio firmware permission is unestablished;
   FDK-AAC explicitly grants no patent license; LDAC's AOSP NOTICE requests
   product certification. aptX library choices have materially different terms.
5. Do not promise per-device LDAC quality control or live bitrate reporting from
   stock BlueALSA 4.3.1. Those interfaces do not exist in the inspected version.

### Evidence vocabulary

`VERIFIED` = implementation plus meaningful matching validation;
`IMPLEMENTED` = code exists, runtime/physical proof incomplete;
`PARTIAL` = only part exists; `WEAK` = architectural/quality concerns;
`MISSING` = no meaningful implementation; `UNKNOWN` = inadequate evidence;
`DEPRECATED / DEAD` = obsolete path. Confidence is HIGH, MEDIUM or LOW.
`PROPOSED` below labels design, not another evidence grade.

| Area | Classification | Confidence | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MT6582 identity, advertised BT version/EDR features | VERIFIED | HIGH | Own retained HCI/WMT responses, not marketing specifications |
| Native transport and adapter power | VERIFIED, narrowly | HIGH | Physical bring-up; no sustained audio implication |
| SBC build and service configuration | VERIFIED | HIGH | Recipe, generated config and ELF dependencies agree |
| Shared DSP to Bluetooth PCM | IMPLEMENTED | HIGH | Real source path and host tests; no retained headphone listening proof |
| Fresh pairing/bonding/reconnect end-to-end | PARTIAL | HIGH | Code exists; trust contract and physical evidence incomplete |
| Actual connected headphone codec capabilities | UNKNOWN | HIGH | No connected peer/PCM in retained inspection |
| SBC/AAC/aptX/HD/LDAC real-time and RF qualification | UNKNOWN | HIGH | No appropriate target measurements found |
| Auto selection, bounded codec fallback, device reliability cache | MISSING | HIGH | Current adapter observes a codec string; no codec policy engine |
| Per-transport LDAC quality ceiling/live bitrate API | MISSING in 4.3.1 | HIGH | Global options/encoder state, not PCM D-Bus properties |

## 2. Hardware: what is actually established

| Property | Finding and limit |
| --- | --- |
| Controller | Integrated `CONSYS_MT6582`, WMT chip `0x6582`, HVR `0x8a01`, FVR `0x8a00`; this is the observed E2/E1-ROM combination, not an external USB or Qualcomm controller |
| HCI/LMP | Both report Bluetooth **4.0**, code `0x06`, revision/subversion 0; manufacturer MediaTek 70 |
| Classic capability | Feature bytes `bf 3e 8d fe db ff 5b 87`: BR/EDR, ACL **2 Mbps and 3 Mbps EDR**, 3-/5-slot EDR packets, AFH central/peripheral and Secure Simple Pairing advertised |
| LE | LE and simultaneous LE/BR-EDR are advertised. LE data is not qualified. This is not LE Audio capability |
| Controller buffering | Read Buffer Size: ACL payload MTU **1021 bytes**, **4** ACL packet credits; this is not the negotiated A2DP/L2CAP MTU or proof of four independent streams |
| AP transport | Reborn/BlueALSA → Linux Bluetooth/L2CAP/HCI → native H4 framing → STP BT channel → BTIF with AP_DMA → CONSYS firmware/radio |
| Shared ownership | Kernel CONSYS parent owns power/reset/calibration/recovery. Wi-Fi uses AHB HIF, not the BT audio PCM transport; radios nevertheless share power/co-clock/coexistence resources |
| Antenna | Own `WMT_SOC.cfg` has `coex_wmt_ant_mode=1`, `co_clock_flag=1`; source interprets shared-antenna arbitration. Physical RF wiring, isolation and PTA performance are not measured |
| Controller quirk | Exact chip/HVR/FVR guard applies `HCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_LOCAL_EXT_FEATURES_PAGE_2`. It does **not** mask EDR/LE capabilities or force Basic Rate |
| Sustainable throughput | UNKNOWN. Advertising 3 Mbps is not 3 Mbps of usable A2DP payload, and says nothing about losses with Wi-Fi traffic |

Sanitized raw-response fields and their exact private-source line locations are

### Firmware and controller limitations

The checked firmware set includes `mt6572_82_patch_e1_0_hdr.bin`,
`mt6572_82_patch_e1_1_hdr.bin`, `WMT_SOC.cfg`, Wi-Fi's `WIFI_RAM_CODE_MT6582`,
and `modem_1_2g_n.img` for cold RF calibration. This is a shared bootstrap,
not five Bluetooth codecs or an Android audio-offload engine.
[Firmware checks](../../../Y2Linux/kernel/platform/connectivity/firmware.c) and
[inventory](../../../Y2Linux/docs/knowledge/evidence/m5-firmware-inventory.json)
identify exact owner-supplied files; every relevant redistribution permission is
still recorded as unestablished. Preserve private calibration and existing
firmware validation; never transplant another unit's records.

The controller transports encoded Classic A2DP packets. SBC, AAC, aptX, aptX HD,
LDAC and applicable vendor A2DP codecs can be **software encoders on the AP**;
ordinary aptX/HD do not intrinsically require a Qualcomm Bluetooth controller.
They still require a matching remote endpoint, encoder, sufficient CPU and RF
budget. A stock firmware command named "codec" in `hci.c::setup` is not evidence
of AP A2DP encoder offload.

LE Audio/LC3 over CIS/BIS requires LE Isochronous Channels introduced in Core
5.2. This controller's 4.0 interface and current driver do not supply that path.
Newer BlueZ libraries or an LC3 library cannot add it.
[Bluetooth SIG LE Audio FAQ](https://www.bluetooth.com/media/le-audio/le-audio-faqs/).
LC3plus over a vendor **Classic A2DP** endpoint is a separate possibility, and
HFP LC3-SWB is a voice profile, not LE Audio or a stereo-music upgrade.

Four ACL credits and the driver's 128-packet software queue/7-frame STP window
are relevant latency/backpressure constraints, not a measured bitrate ceiling.
Encoded payload alone at 330/660/990 kbps is approximately 41/83/124 kB/s, before
RTP/L2CAP/HCI/STP overhead, air retransmissions and antenna sharing. Wi-Fi scans
with Bluetooth merely powered do not validate any of these sustained loads.
Historical donor Basic Rate workarounds are not this unit's qualified policy.

## 3. Actual software and build state

| Component | Audited production input / retained build |
| --- | --- |
| Buildroot | 2025.02.17, Cortex-A7 ARMv7 hard-float target |
| BlueZ | **5.79**; generated `config.h` agrees with recipe |
| BlueALSA | **4.3.1**, generated version `v4.3.1` |
| SBC library | **2.0**, selected automatically by BlueALSA package |
| FFmpeg | 9.0.1 media decoding/DSP; no A2DP encoders enabled there |
| Daemon name | **`/usr/bin/bluealsa`**, not `bluealsad` in this version |
| Service arguments | `-p a2dp-source --loglevel=warning`, both initial launch and supervised restart |
| A2DP codec enabled | SBC; default `sbc_quality = SBC_QUALITY_HIGH` |
| Disabled optional codecs | AAC, aptX, aptX HD, LDAC, FastStream, LC3plus, Opus, MPEG/MP3; mSBC/LC3-SWB also not enabled |

Evidence: [production defconfig](../../../Y2Linux/buildroot/configs/y2_production_defconfig),
[input lock](../../../Y2Linux/buildroot/inputs.lock.json),
[service](../../../Y2Linux/buildroot/board/y2/production-overlay/usr/libexec/y2/connectivity).
The companion ledger identifies the ignored retained build tree and exact
generated files. Its ARM executable links `libsbc.so.1` and no optional codec
library; configuration/source inspection also excludes static optional codecs.
This does not establish which image is currently installed on a powered device.

The pinned Buildroot recipe couples codecs to independently selected packages:
FDK-AAC → `--enable-aac`; libopenaptx → both aptX variants; libopus → Opus;
LAME → MP3 encoder. These are explicit recipe branches, **not compiler
autodetection**, but adding an unrelated library can broaden Bluetooth capability.
FDK-AAC and libopenaptx are not selected today. There is no existing LDAC,
libfreeaptx, LC3plus or LHDC production package in this Buildroot tree.

Upstream **5.0.0, dated 2026-08-27**, adds LHDC v3 and changes executable names,
PCM rate property names and other interfaces. It also fixes Android-Opus
configuration. Do not paste its manual into a 4.3.1 integration or upgrade it
incidentally while enabling a codec. [Upstream release notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arkq/bluez-alsa/master/NEWS.md).

### BlueZ versus BlueALSA

BlueZ handles discovery, bonds, profile signaling and transport setup. It does
not become an AAC/LDAC encoder because audio plugins are enabled. BlueALSA
registers local A2DP endpoints, configures the remote transport, encodes PCM and
writes acquired transport file descriptors. The per-packet audio data is not
passed through a D-Bus method or copied through the `bluetoothd` process.

## 4. Codec capability matrix

This table is deliberately wider than the recommended set. Bitrates are nominal
encoded payload operating points, **not measured Y2 maxima**. Every Y2 sustained
maximum, encoder CPU percentage and incremental RSS is currently UNKNOWN.
CPU/memory categories are architecture-based estimates (LOW confidence), not
benchmarks. ARM "plausible" is source portability, not a successful Y2 build.

| Codec | Transport | Local encoder available | BlueALSA support | ARMv7 | Remote compatibility | Nominal bitrate / Y2 practical max | Input rates, kHz | CPU / memory estimate | Wi-Fi risk | License status | Y2 recommendation |

Sources for the matrix: retained `src/a2dp-{sbc,aac,aptx,aptx-hd,ldac,lc3plus,mpeg,opus,faststream}.c`
and `codec-sbc.c` in the pinned build; [versioned upstream source tree](https://github.com/arkq/bluez-alsa/tree/v4.3.1/src);

[current integration prerequisites](https://github.com/arkq/bluez-alsa/wiki/Installation-from-source).
The legal sources are separated in §6. Apple's [AAC description](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118295)
supports the AAC ecosystem rationale, not an assertion that a particular peer
advertised it to this Y2.

Other recognizable codec IDs, PipeWire Opus variants, Samsung proprietary
codecs, ATRAC, MPEG-D/USAC and HFP voice codecs must not become UI choices merely because a
header names them. `a2dp-codecs.c` has names for more codecs than `a2dp.c` has
actual encoder endpoints. ASHA/G.722 in newer BlueALSA is a separate hearing-aid
profile, not this A2DP-headphone project. Neither ASHA nor LC3-SWB justifies
claiming LE Audio.

## 5. Important codec-specific conclusions

### SBC is a useful quality baseline

The service already defaults to **high**, not a deliberately poor mode.
BlueALSA chooses bitpool inside peer limits. In 4.3.1, XQ requests dual channel,
44.1 kHz, 16 blocks, 8 subbands, loudness allocation, bitpool 38; XQ+ uses 47.
These yield approximately 452 and 551 kbps. An older release-note number is not
the current algorithm. XQ source initialization restricts advertised frequency
and channel mode globally. Do not use `--sbc-quality=xq` as a casual production
default: that changes the mandatory fallback's compatibility surface.

Model `codec=Sbc` and `quality=Xq` separately. A headset does not advertise an
"SBC XQ codec". Check the legal SBC configuration and actual peer behavior;
never exceed the peer's bitpool or use `NonConformant=true` for Auto. A lower
bitpool fallback can be proposed inside negotiated bounds; if a peer cannot
support the chosen setting, skip it, do not force it.

### AAC: useful, but select the encoder deliberately

The inspected implementation uses **FDK-AAC**, not FFmpeg's AAC decoder or native
AAC encoder. Initial product policy should use AAC-LC, stereo 44.1/48 kHz,
conformant transport, and a measured target such as 256 kbps clipped to remote
limits. That target is a proposal; today's optional-code default would be 220
kbps, with afterburner off. Keep afterburner an engineering benchmark variable,
not another ordinary user setting. It improves analysis at extra CPU/memory cost.
Do not enable `--aac-true-bps` or nonconformant fragmentation as a quality shortcut.
FDK's actual negotiated profile/rate/VBR behavior must be observed.

### aptX families are not interchangeable

Classic aptX and aptX HD have viable software implementations. The stock
Buildroot dependency is **libopenaptx 0.2.1, GPL-3.0+**, not LGPL.
**libfreeaptx** is the LGPL-2.1+ fork supported by BlueALSA's
`--with-libfreeaptx` option; adding it requires a deliberate pinned package.
Official AOSP also contains Apache-2.0 aptX/HD encoder source, but it is not a
drop-in package/API selected by the current recipe. Do not build a new adapter
only to avoid understanding existing library/license choices.

Do not ship `arkq/openaptx`'s reverse-engineered/proprietary archive variants by
default; its own README carries a binary-distribution warning. Do not generalize
that warning to mean all aptX encoders are equally licensed or prohibited.
Adaptive and Lossless are different technologies, absent from this encoder
integration. Qualcomm describes Lossless as an Adaptive/Snapdragon Sound
capability. Their exclusion is an implementation/platform/licensing conclusion,
not a claim that all vendor Classic codecs require Bluetooth 5.2.
[Qualcomm Lossless description](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/09/qualcomm-adds-bluetooth-lossless-audio-technology-snapdragon-sound).

### LDAC: adaptive does not mean "safe at 990"

Sony's AOSP encoder plus ABR is the relevant source-side implementation. The
Linux packaging supplies `ldacBT-enc` and `ldacBT-abr`; an LDAC decoder is not
needed to transmit to headphones. BlueALSA 4.3.1 advertises 44.1/48/88.2/96 kHz,
and initializes its encoder with **S32 PCM**. This is not a promise of lossless
32-bit reproduction. A codec capability is not the selected rate: LDAC does not
imply 96 kHz.

Public fixed operating points are 330/660/990 kbps in the 48-kHz family and
303/606/909 in the 44.1-kHz family. ABR can traverse additional intermediate
quality levels: the inspected AOSP ABR table includes 492/396 kbps at 96 kHz.
Do not implement a three-value "measured bitrate" enum.
[Sony overview](https://www.sony.net/Products/LDAC/),
[AOSP ABR source](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libldac/+/refs/heads/main/abr/src/ldacBT_abr.c).

In the pinned encoder thread, ABR observes **local transport socket queue depth**
and blocking writes, not actual over-air packet-loss percentage or headphone
buffer health. Its thresholds are 6/4/2 queue units. `--ldac-quality=standard`
sets the starting encoder mode; adding `--ldac-abr` does **not** establish a
documented 660-kbps ceiling. ABR may increase quality again. Neither the selected
LDAC capability blob nor `PCM1.CodecConfiguration` contains current ABR bitrate.

Consequently:

* Stock 4.3.1 experimental testing can use one fixed daemon-wide quality, or
  uncapped ABR while explicitly treating all its reachable levels as experimental.
* Production Auto must not claim a capped adaptive mode without an enforceable,
  tested per-transport ceiling and actual mode feedback.
* Stock API fallback can change **codec** after closing/reopening PCM. It cannot
  honestly implement the complete per-device runtime LDAC quality ladder.
* Do not restart the global daemon on every underrun to simulate quality control.
  This would disturb connection ownership and all PCM objects.
* Do not display `660 kbps` as live fact merely because Standard was requested.

## 6. Licensing and redistribution gates

This is an engineering distribution audit, not a legal clearance. Copyright
permission, patent scope, brand/logo use, product certification and firmware
redistribution are different questions. A free source download settles none of
the others automatically. Review the intended countries and whether Reborn is
distributed as source, a binary firmware image, or hardware.

## 7. PCM and precision contract

### Current, inspected path

```text
16-bit FLAC -> FFmpeg s16 ----+
                            +-> stereo FLTP at source rate
24/96 FLAC -> FFmpeg s32 ----+   -> shared volume/ReplayGain/EQ/limiter
                                -> FFmpeg final swresample
                                -> packed S16, 44.1 or 48 kHz requested for BT
                                -> ALSA "bluealsa:" plug wrapper
                                -> BlueALSA SBC S16 encoder -> A2DP
```

[media.c](../../crates/reborn-media/native/media.c) creates `canonical_swr` with
the decoder rate on both sides and FLTP output; `output_swr` performs final
sink-rate/format adaptation. [Bluetooth status](../../crates/reborn-platform/src/bluetooth.rs)
matches exact connected peer, `A2DP-source`, `mode=sink`, stereo 44.1/48 kHz.
[ALSA adapter](../../crates/reborn-audio/src/native.rs) chooses S16 whenever output
is Bluetooth. It does not select based on `PCM1.Format`.

The shipped ALSA `bluealsa` definition is itself a **`type plug` wrapper**, not
necessarily a conversion-free raw PCM. Current rate matching reduces accidental
resampling for SBC, but a future wider-format codec could silently receive an
S16-derived signal converted again by ALSA. Inspect the slave's negotiated
format; accepting an application S32 buffer through `plug` is not precision proof.

FLTP is 32-bit IEEE floating point, approximately 24 significant binary bits,
not 32-bit integer precision. S32 buffers in parts of playback/crossfade do not
change that. Preserve the common DSP's existing precision; a future wider DSP
decision is separate work, not a Bluetooth codec change. The existing broad
[audio audit](../audit/current-system/05_AUDIO_AUDIT.md) also records unresolved
gapless/transition/limiter/lifecycle concerns. This review does not certify those
features merely because the user asks that they not regress.

### Negotiated final format, not codec-name inference

| Codec integration in 4.3.1 | BlueALSA PCM input | Channels / rates | Reborn adaptation needed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SBC, AAC, aptX, MPEG, Android Opus | `S16_LE`, property `0x8210` | SBC/AAC can negotiate mono/stereo; aptX stereo; Opus mono/stereo; supported rates in matrix | Final float → S16 only at sink; explicitly tested dither/rounding policy |
| aptX HD, LC3plus | `S24_LE` in a **4-byte** container, `0x8418` (`S24_4LE` in BlueALSA naming) | HD stereo; LC3plus mono/stereo; intersect actual rates | Add correct signed 24-in-32 packing/ALSA format; not packed 3-byte S24 and not S32 amplitude layout |
| LDAC | `S32_LE`, `0x8420`; encoder called with `LDACBT_SMPL_FMT_S32` | Mono/dual/stereo in capabilities; initial product stereo at 44.1/48 | Final float → S32 at boundary; do not first narrow to S16 |
| FastStream | S16 music + separate S16 mono voice PCM | 44.1/48 music, 16 voice | Not selected for product; never mistake backchannel for playback |
| LHDC v3, upstream 5.0 only | Version-specific 16/24-bit configuration and 32-bit internal buffers | Stereo, 44.1/48/96 | Out of initial scope; inspect actual future PCM `Format`, not a v4 assumption |

The AAC capability helpers also recognize 5.1/7.1 channel configurations for
applicable profiles. They are not an invitation to add surround output: Reborn's
canonical/player contract is stereo, and initial codec selection must request
and validate two channels explicitly.

A future `SinkSpec` must contain actual format, physical and valid bit widths,
rate, channel layout, device identity and transport generation. Always validate
properties after selection and again at open. Handle unknown values as a failed
candidate, not an implicit S16 conversion.

Use one final sink converter. Prefer exact source rate **within an already
qualified common set** when starting a new audio session; otherwise 44.1-family
sources → 44.1, 48-family sources → 48, then an available qualified alternative.
Do not upsample 44.1 to 96 for a logo. Start with 44.1/48 for Auto even on LDAC;
24/96 is downsampled once at the sink boundary until separately qualified.
Do not reconfigure the Bluetooth rate at every track boundary: keep it stable
through gapless/crossfade and let the final converter handle source changes.

Volume ownership also needs an explicit contract. BlueALSA 4.3.1 defaults to
software attenuation and persists volume state; Reborn already applies volume
in its shared DSP. Establish a controlled neutral encoder-side gain or a clearly
defined remote-volume arrangement, with quiet-level physical testing. Never
force a headset to maximum volume just to simplify gain accounting. Do not let
independent persisted attenuation or AVRCP events create two volume authorities.

## 8. Production negotiation architecture — PROPOSED

### Responsibilities and typed state

```text
AppModel: Auto/manual intent, output choice, playback intent
    | Action/Effect
BluetoothService (existing worker extended, one bounded coordinator)
    +-- BlueZ adapter: paired device + remote SEP capability observations
    +-- BlueALSA adapter: local runtime inventory + usable codec intersection
    +-- pure CodecPolicy: ordered eligible candidates, no I/O
    +-- negotiation state machine: bounded attempts and generation checks
    +-- bounded DeviceProfileStore: preferences / compact stability evidence
    | SinkReady(actual format, transport generation)
Playback owner: stop/quiesce/open/resume the SAME media pipeline
    | service events
AppModel -> UI and rebornctl: preference distinct from actual negotiated state
```

No generic plugin architecture, per-codec service threads, new DSP or external
policy daemon is needed. Wire strings are decoded once inside the BlueALSA
adapter; arbitrary strings do not propagate through application policy.

Illustrative types, **not implementation**:

```text
Codec = Sbc | Aac | Aptx | AptxHd | Ldac
ObservedCodec = Known(Codec) | Unknown { standard_id, vendor_id, vendor_codec_id }
Preference = Auto | Prefer(Codec)       // manual means preference + safe fallback
SbcQuality = NormalHigh | Conservative | Xq | XqPlus
LdacQuality = Adaptive { ceiling } | Fixed(Connection | Standard | High)
CapabilityState = Unknown | Observed { connection_epoch, endpoints }
Stability = Unproven | StableInContext | Suspect | SuppressedForSession

CodecState {
  compiled_local, runtime_enabled_local,
  advertised_remote, mutually_usable,
  requested_preference, policy_choice, negotiation_attempt,
  negotiated: Option<ActualPcmAndCodec>,
  requested_quality, observed_quality: Option<QualityObservation>,
  fallback_reason, fallback_count, stability,
  bluez_owner_epoch, bluealsa_owner_epoch, connection_epoch, sink_epoch
}
```

SBC XQ is a quality mode. Unknown advertised codecs may appear in diagnostics,
not in the selectable menu. Per-device codec preferences belong in the service
profile store; global default Auto belongs in app settings. Do not persist a
second authoritative copy in AppModel.

### Version-specific discovery and selection

1. Read `org.bluealsa.Manager1` at `/org/bluealsa`: `Version`, `Profiles`,
   `Codecs`. Filter `A2DP-source:` entries (actual D-Bus spelling, not the lowercase
   command-line profile argument). This is the enabled daemon inventory,
   not a full compiled-library inventory. Compare against a generated firmware
   codec manifest to identify disabled/missing/mismatched capabilities.
2. Subscribe to BlueZ ObjectManager and property changes for the selected
   `Device1`. After profile discovery, enumerate its **remote**
   `org.bluez.MediaEndpoint1` sink objects. Read `UUID`, `Codec`, `Capabilities`,
   `Device`; parse vendor IDs from bounded codec blobs where necessary.
   In 5.79 source these properties are exported without a separate `Vendor`
   property, despite newer/general documentation discussing one.
3. Read BlueALSA ObjectManager PCMs, matching exact device, `A2DP-source` and
   `Mode=sink`. Call that PCM's `GetCodecs()`, signature `a{sa{sv}}`.
   In 4.3.1 its `Capabilities`, `SupportedChannels`, `SupportedSampling` are
   **already intersected with enabled local capabilities**. Do not label this
   result a complete list of all codecs advertised by the headphones.
4. Unknown/missing SEP discovery is `Unknown`, not `remote supports only SBC`.
   Existing actually negotiated SBC can remain a safe baseline when complete
   inventory is unavailable. A2DP UUID alone says nothing about optional codecs.
5. Compute a candidate. Ask playback to quiesce/close the old PCM first. Call
   `SelectCodec(name, {Channels: byte, Sampling: uint32})` in **4.3.1**. Use a
   validated codec configuration only where policy genuinely needs it; never
   disable conformance checks. In 5.0 the rate key is `Rate`, requiring an
   explicit version adapter, not speculative support.
6. A successful method return means accepted request, not proven audio. Observe
   new/current `PCM1.Codec`, `CodecConfiguration`, `Format`, `Channels`,
   `Sampling`, then open exact PCM and confirm `Running` plus write progress.
   Reconfiguration can destroy/recreate PCM objects. Reject stale generation
   callbacks even if an object path is reused.
7. Report requested, policy-selected and negotiated values separately. If the
   remote/stack instead establishes SBC, observe and validate SBC; never report
   the requested LDAC as active. Clear active state on owner/transport loss.

The 4.3.1 `GetCodecs` implementation deduplicates equal codec IDs and picks the
first matching remote SEP for selection. Different endpoints with the same codec
can have different capabilities. Keep raw remote observations separately; do not
invent a union configuration that no individual endpoint accepts. If the
adapter cannot select the desired endpoint safely, skip that candidate. This
needs real multi-SEP fixtures and peer tests.

Sources: local `bluealsa-iface.xml`, `bluealsa-dbus.c::{ba_variant_populate_remote_sep,
bluealsa_pcm_get_codecs,bluealsa_pcm_select_codec}`, `doc/org.bluealsa.PCM1.7.rst`,
BlueZ `profiles/audio/a2dp.c::register_remote_sep` and
[versioned BlueZ API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluez/bluez/5.79/doc/org.bluez.MediaEndpoint.rst).
Reborn must not register competing endpoints, acquire BlueALSA's media fd, run
`bluetoothctl` parsers, or send vendor HCI commands to select a codec.

### Quality-control gap: honest implementation boundary

Codec/rate selection and actual-format observation are possible with existing
standard interfaces. Per-device live LDAC quality/ABR ceilings, current bitrate
and structured encoder-error/queue metrics are **not** available in stock 4.3.1.
Do not invent D-Bus properties and write UI against them as if they existed.

For the full target, prefer a small reviewed/upstreamable **BlueALSA transport
extension**, with validated per-PCM quality request, allowed ceiling, actual
encoder mode/bitrate and aggregated errors. Keep ABR inside the encoder owner;
Reborn supplies limits and policy, not per-packet decisions. A namespaced API
must be feature-detected and versioned. Its implementation/locking/error-path
review is separate future work. Newer 5.0 documentation alone does not supply
this quality API either.

Without that extension, ship only behavior the stock interface can support:
codec choice and bounded codec fallback; one fixed LDAC daemon quality in an
explicit experimental image; `observed_bitrate=null` where not known. Do not
advertise the complete adaptive-quality UX yet.

## 9. Auto policy — deterministic proposal, not an asserted quality ranking

### Eligibility precedes ranking

```text
compiled ∩ runtime-enabled ∩ actually mutually usable
    ∩ distribution-approved ∩ platform-qualified-for-context
    ∩ supported PCM formats/rates ∩ acceptable resource budget
    minus session failures and per-device/context exclusions
        -> ranked candidates, always preserving conformant SBC fallback
```

No legal/qualification waiver is inferred from manual mode. Laboratory firmware
may have a visibly experimental allowlist; production Auto must not select it.
On today's reviewed image the effective list is **SBC only**. No headphone
profile has been supplied or observed in this audit.

Future initial policy profiles below apply **only after the named codec/mode
passes all gates**. They express engineering tradeoffs, not a claim that AAC
always sounds better than aptX or LDAC always sounds better than SBC.

| Context | Exact initial candidate order |
| --- | --- |
| First connection, no per-device history | Qualified SBC High baseline for this first session; observe device/transport. Do not silently experiment on a public user |
| Known peer, normal CPU budget, Wi-Fi off or qualified idle coexistence | LDAC capped Adaptive Standard (≤606/660) → aptX HD → AAC-LC target 256 → aptX → SBC High → SBC Conservative |
| Active Wi-Fi traffic or repeated scans, no strong peer coex result | AAC-LC target 256 → aptX → SBC High → SBC Conservative. Exclude HD/LDAC until their active-coexistence profile is qualified |
| Active Wi-Fi, peer has specific stable capped-LDAC coex record | LDAC capped Adaptive Standard → AAC-LC → aptX → SBC High → SBC Conservative; omit aptX HD unless separately coex-qualified, then place it after LDAC |
| Measured encoding/CPU pressure | If aptX is measured cheaper and qualified for this peer/context: aptX → SBC High → SBC Conservative; otherwise SBC High → SBC Conservative. Exclude AAC/LDAC/HD until their measured budget passes |
| User preference for an eligible codec | Requested codec/mode first; on failure remove failed candidate and use the relevant Auto list; publish explicit fallback reason |

The CPU-pressure row's aptX qualification does not prove reduced load just from
the name; if no measurements establish a benefit, the row reduces to SBC High →
Conservative. CPU budget is a filter, not an excuse to continuously switch a
working codec. Existing stable sessions stay in place unless meaningful failure
thresholds are crossed.

Why these defaults: capped LDAC offers a plausible wider-input quality path
without automatically targeting 990; HD offers 24-bit input at moderate fixed
payload; FDK AAC provides useful compatibility and lower payload if CPU allows;
aptX is a plausible lower-cost alternative. Standard high-quality SBC is a
serious fallback. Under congestion, payload and measured stability outrank codec
branding. All ordering is revisioned and can be changed by qualification results.

For a peer offering SBC/AAC/LDAC, the first unknown session therefore uses SBC;
after a compatible baseline and approved codec qualification, normal-context
order is capped LDAC → AAC → SBC High → Conservative. That differs intentionally
from blindly choosing 990 on first contact. During experimental qualification,
an explicit laboratory profile may start with capped LDAC to exercise that path.

Precisely, persist `baseline_observed` after the 30-minute stable SBC observation
defined below. At the **next connection session**, this permits the ranked list
of already release-qualified optional codecs; do not interrupt the baseline
session to upgrade. A known-good optional codec may lead the list when higher
choices are unproven on that peer. A successful SBC baseline alone does not
permanently pin Auto to SBC: only failures, exclusions or resource/context gates
do that. This is deterministic device learning, not in-session exploration.

LDAC **Connection Priority** can be attempted once as a downgrade from capped
Standard after persistent congestion; if it remains unstable, use the remaining
Auto list. Do not assert that 303/330 is always acoustically preferable to
well-encoded AAC. If AAC is already proven for this device/context, prefer that
proven AAC fallback over introducing an unproven low-LDAC setting.

### Stickiness, source format and coexistence

* Keep a demonstrated working choice for the session. Device history may promote
  a stable choice above an unproven higher-ranked choice, but never restore a
  codec excluded by the new firmware's legal/hardware allowlist.
* Treat Wi-Fi Off, ConnectedIdle, ActiveTraffic, Scanning and Unknown separately.
  Current code does not expose a complete traffic-load classifier. Proposed
  classification uses existing scan state plus low-rate byte-counter deltas,
  not permanent packet capture. Unknown uses the conservative context.
* Proposed active threshold: ≥128 kbit/s combined Wi-Fi traffic averaged over
  10 s, or ≥2 scans in 60 s. Hold that context 60 s after the last qualifying
  event. These are initial **testable policy constants**, not measured RF limits.
* One scan or Wi-Fi becoming connected must not interrupt healthy playback.
  At most lower an available ABR ceiling; change codec only for meaningful
  instability or the next session. Never automatically turn Wi-Fi off.
* Choose qualified source-family rate at session start, then hold it across
  track changes. A 16-bit source does not require wider output, and a 24-bit
  source does not justify an unqualified RF mode.
* No automatic 990/909 or 96-kHz promotion in the initial production policy.
  Manual High remains experimental until separately qualified. Do not show a
  setting that the daemon cannot actually apply and verify.

## 10. Fallback state machine — PROPOSED

```text

                    Exhausted <- no candidates <- Quiesce / Downgrade
```

All deadlines use monotonic time. Key state by daemon-owner and connection
generation; stale completion cannot reopen a previous device or revive playback
after Stop. No busy wait, no per-packet logs, no hidden reconnect loop.

### Initial limits and observable causes

| Condition | Proposed response / threshold |
| --- | --- |
| Unsupported codec/configuration, malformed capabilities, unknown PCM format | Reject candidate immediately; record typed reason; no same-candidate automatic retry |
| SelectCodec timeout / transport startup failure | 5 s method deadline, 10 s actual-PCM/open deadline, within 45 s overall negotiation budget; try next candidate |
| Explicit encoder initialization failure | Candidate fails immediately; current API may expose only failed startup, so use that honest reason unless structured encoder signal exists |
| D-Bus service temporarily restarting | At most one same-candidate retry after owner reappears, with fresh epoch/inventory; 2 s backoff; counts within total attempt budget |
| One recoverable XRUN / transient write delay | Recover locally, record; no codec switch or persistent failure penalty |
| ≥3 distinct transport-attributed starvation/XRUN episodes in 60 s | Mark suspect; after 2 s settling allowance, bounded quiesce and downgrade. Coalesce symptoms within 2 s into one episode |
| Fatal transport write failure / PCM loss while device remains connected | Attempt next allowed candidate once resources are closed; do not wait for a cooldown on a dead stream |
| ≥2 unexplained disconnects within 120 s, each within 10 s of codec startup | Suppress candidate for session; next connection uses remaining candidates; exclude intentional disconnect/headphone power-off evidence |
| SD removal, decoder error, producer queue empty | Media/source failure, not codec evidence; pause/report through playback; no codec downgrade penalty |
| Wi-Fi scan, low RSSI, CPU spike, or no packet-loss telemetry | Not sufficient on its own to blame a codec |
| User Stop / Disconnect / radio Off / Forget | Cancel all codec timers and pending work; no automatic resume or re-pair |
| No usable candidate / SBC fails | Pause with one actionable "Bluetooth audio unavailable" state; no silent speaker playback and no repeated popups |

Stock Reborn cannot currently attribute all these events: it lacks structured
BlueALSA encoder errors/queue telemetry and currently samples only a few PCM
properties. Do not implement the threshold by scraping warning text or calling
every decoder underrun a radio failure. Missing telemetry remains unknown.

### Bounded retries and no flapping

* Construct at most six distinct codec/mode candidates, including SBC High and
  Conservative. An LDAC Connection downgrade consumes a candidate slot; if adding
  it would exceed six after a congestion failure, remove fixed-rate aptX HD
  first, then aptX if AAC is already proven in that context. Never remove both
  SBC fallback modes to make room for optional experiments.
* Each candidate gets one selection attempt per fallback session, except the
  single service-restart retry above; the visited set survives rapid connection-
  epoch changes as described below. Maximum seven selection attempts across the fallback
  session. Initial startup and each later recovery episode have a 45-s deadline;
  entering recovery does not reset the session's candidate/attempt budget.
  Reserve the final 15 s for a conformant SBC startup: by 30 s stop launching
  optional candidates and select the untried SBC baseline. Conservative SBC is
  attempted if budget remains after a prompt High failure. Quiesce/reconciliation
  time is inside the same budget, not an unbounded prelude.
* A D-Bus client timeout does not cancel the remote method. Never issue competing
  SelectCodec calls while an earlier operation can still reconfigure the stream.
  Reconcile actual transport state/epochs after a bounded settling wait; accept
  a verified safe SBC transport or terminate as exhausted if safe serialization
  cannot be established. Ignore stale replies and do not extend the deadline.
* While audio still works, no policy-driven codec reconfiguration more often
  than once per 60 s. Same-transport ABR reduction may occur sooner; ABR remains
  inside BlueALSA with a fixed maximum. A fatal stream can fall through without
  waiting 60 s, but only to an untried candidate.
* A failed codec/mode is not automatically promoted again in this session.
  Track changes, scans and repeated UI refreshes do not reset the failure set.
* Reconnects within five minutes retain the fallback session and attempt set.
  A session ends after five minutes disconnected, explicit Forget, or a deliberate
  advanced "Retry preferred" operation. Reboot preserves the compact failure
  history, rather than immediately repeating a known bad high mode.
* Ordinary reconnect to a previously successful, **not failed/suppressed**
  current codec may reopen its newly observed PCM once per connection epoch,
  without another SelectCodec or promotion. This is a separate resume transition,
  not an opportunity to retry failed candidates. Revalidate format/gates and
  preserve paused intent. If the stack negotiates an allowed lower fallback,
  observe it honestly instead of immediately forcing the old higher codec.
  A failed resume enters the remaining fallback list; repeated reconnects are
  bounded by the connection-owner contract below.
* A user-requested Retry creates a fresh bounded budget; it cannot race with an
  existing negotiation. Background upgrade probing is excluded from version one.
* Persistent two-failure evidence suppresses that codec/context for the next
  three connection sessions; a user can explicitly retry. Count sessions rather
  than trusting Y2's currently unreliable wall clock. A software/capability
  fingerprint change marks history stale rather than treating it as permanent.

For a finite ordered candidate vector `C`, record each attempt in a monotone
visited set `V`; automatic fallback always chooses from `C \ V`, never removes
an element from `V`, and never upgrades. Thus one session cannot oscillate
LDAC → SBC → LDAC. Resuming the current nonfailed codec is not a promotion or
a fresh fallback selection. This is a **design invariant**, not a proved property of
today's nonexistent Auto implementation; test vectors are in the companion file.

### Connection retry and audio recovery must not fight

[Y2 reconnect helper](../../../Y2Linux/tools/connectivity/reconnect.c) is already
the preferred-device connection owner; BlueZ built-in reconnect is disabled.
It makes bounded-rate requests but can keep trying once per minute indefinitely.
Do not add another independent Device1.Connect loop inside CodecPolicy.

The full design needs a narrow coordination contract: codec reconfiguration,
intentional disconnect and exhausted-audio recovery can inhibit helper retries;
only the connection owner performs bounded profile reconnect requests. An
exhausted codec session stays exhausted even if the current helper reconnects
the link. Reconnection alone does not reset codec attempts. A transient app-only
lease must expire safely on crash; explicit user radio/disconnect intent must
remain authoritative. This contract is currently missing and blocks a claim of
complete end-to-end bounded fallback.

Initial proposed connection-owner limit: at most two automatic profile reconnect
requests for one unexpected loss, 10-s request deadline, 2-s backoff and a 25-s
total recovery budget. These limits are separate from the codec-selection
budget and are **not implemented by today's helper**. Do not overlap requests
after a client timeout; reconcile a late remote completion or stop. Exhaustion
waits for explicit user Connect or a genuinely new peer-initiated connection,
not a once-per-minute timer forever. Known user/headphone-off intent bypasses
automatic retries. Qualify these deadlines with real devices before adoption.

Fresh pairing also must explicitly establish the user's approved trust policy.
Do not trust every discovered device. The helper requires paired + trusted +
AudioSink; Reborn's current pairing code does not set Trusted. Qualify fresh
onboarding without preconfigured owner bonds.

### Playback continuity and volume safety

Close/quiesce the old sink before reconfiguration, invalidate old PCM jobs, then
open the observed new sink. Preserve queue identity, track, user pause state,
DSP settings and logical position. Hold only a bounded amount of canonical PCM;
do not decode minutes ahead during negotiations. Reconfigure the final
converter, not the decoder/DSP authority. Do not replay stale old-rate buffers.

Codec changes in Classic A2DP are **not guaranteed sample-continuous**. A short
audible gap may be unavoidable; no claim of seamless fallback. Do not guess
exact heard position from bytes merely queued to Bluetooth. Use the existing
playback clock/delay contract and expose interruption diagnostics. Rate changes
at ordinary queue boundaries should be avoided so gapless is not unnecessarily
broken. Existing `Runtime::load` probe-before-worker-stop behavior and sink
generation/cancellation tests deserve attention before expanding this path.

On genuine peer disappearance preserve paused intent; never start wired output
automatically at an unsafe volume. Current core changes Bluetooth output to
Wired and pauses on `BluetoothDisconnected`; deliberate codec reconfiguration
must not be mistaken for this user-visible unplug event.

## 11. Bounded per-device persistence — PROPOSED

Store under Reborn's existing private state root, not BlueZ's bond/key files.
One versioned atomic JSON record set, maximum **32 paired devices**, **six codec
entries/device**, two qualification contexts (quiet/congested), saturating small
counters. Evict forgotten/unpaired entries first, then least recently used.

Fields: schema/policy revision; private paired-device identity; capability and
firmware/encoder fingerprints; optional manual preference; last stable
codec/rate/quality ceiling per context; stable-session count; capped failure count;
`baseline_observed`; remaining suppressed-session count; latest bounded reason code. Do not store
packet histories, media titles, SSIDs, bond keys or raw calibration. Unknown
vendor capability blobs need not be persisted.

An initial stable observation means 30 minutes of progressing playback without
codec-attributed faults in the recorded context. It permits a device-history
hint, **not product qualification**. High-quality mode history must be based on
observed mode, not just requested mode. Do not manufacture "highest stable 660"
while ABR feedback is unavailable.

Write on changed preference, a new stable milestone, or session termination;
coalesce automatic writes to at most once per five minutes, skip unchanged
content, and flush a pending summary during orderly shutdown. Atomic temporary
file + rename + appropriate file/directory sync; no per-packet/XRUN writes.
Corrupt/unsupported schema resets learning to Unknown/Auto safely, without
removing bonds or inventing negotiated codec state. Migration must preserve an
unsupported manual preference as unavailable, not silently relabel it active.

## 12. Observability and UI — PROPOSED

Use the existing bounded event ring/structured logger, not another telemetry
system. Events: inventory ready/mismatch, remote capability snapshot, candidate
selection, attempt started/completed/timed out, actual codec/format changed,
quality ceiling changed, transport lost/restored, fallback and exhausted.
Fields include device pseudonym, session/sink epochs, correlation ID, codec,
rate/channels/format, request vs observation, bounded reason code and elapsed
time. Aggregate underruns/blocked writes periodically; never log audio packets.
Logs stay in RAM by default; diagnostic persistence is deliberate and bounded.

Packet loss is `null/not_observable` unless an actual reliable source supplies it.
Local `TIOCOUTQ`, RSSI and ALSA underruns are not packet-loss percentage. Protect
Bluetooth MACs/device names in exported bundles; no bond keys, passkeys or raw
SDP/HCI payload capture by default.

The following command/schema is **not implemented today**:

```text
rebornctl bluetooth status --json
```

Illustrative **hypothetical** state, not a captured Y2 result:

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "device": "paired-device-1",
  "local_enabled": ["sbc", "aac", "ldac"],
  "remote_capabilities_state": "observed",
  "remote_codecs": ["sbc", "aac", "ldac"],
  "mutually_usable": ["sbc", "aac", "ldac"],
  "preference": "auto",
  "policy_choice": "ldac",
  "negotiated": {"codec": "aac", "rate_hz": 48000, "channels": 2, "format": "s16le"},
  "requested_quality": null,
  "observed_bitrate_bps": null,
  "stability": "suppressed_ldac_for_session",
  "fallback_count": 1,
  "latest_fallback_reason": "transport_start_timeout"
}
```

Actual current tools are `rebornctl status --json`, `audio --json`, logs/events,
and radio on/off/scan. The parser currently rejects `bluetooth status`; do not
present the proposed command as an installation check that already works.

Normal UI: **Codec: Auto** and **Active: SBC/AAC/LDAC**, from observed state only.
Display "Negotiating" or "Unavailable" when appropriate. If bitrate is not
observable, use "LDAC · Adaptive" only when adaptive mode itself is confirmed;
otherwise simply "LDAC". Never synthesize a live kbps value from preferences.

Manual menu includes only compiled, runtime-enabled, release-approved codecs.
Show an unsupported-on-this-headphone choice disabled with explanation, or reject
it without disturbing working playback. If a previously saved preference is
unavailable, preserve it as an unavailable preference and visibly show the actual
fallback in Audio Info. Manual means "prefer", not "lie about strict success".
Keep ordinary fallback quiet—no popup. Show one warning only when no usable
Bluetooth audio connection can be established. Advanced diagnostics may explain
why Auto chose differently.

## 13. Build changes required later, not made here

| Candidate | Required deliberate integration |
| --- | --- |
| SBC policy | Preserve libsbc and mandatory SBC; explicit normal quality/role; add inventory/format observation and tests. Do not globally constrain fallback to XQ |
| AAC | Select pinned FDK-AAC and legal assets; explicit `--enable-aac`; approved LC/profile/bitrate settings; verify ARM ELF dependencies and encoder behavior |
| aptX/HD | Prefer evaluating a pinned libfreeaptx package with `--with-libfreeaptx --enable-aptx --enable-aptx-hd`; adjust existing recipe branch so libopenaptx is not simultaneously selected; preserve source/license hashes |
| LDAC | Add pinned source-side libldac/ldacBT encoder+ABR package, hashes/licenses/NOTICE and `--enable-ldac`; no decoder binary dependency; explicit daemon codec enablement and qualification-gated mode |
| XQ | No new codec library; needs safe per-transport quality/config policy, baseline fallback preserved and real peer tests |
| MPEG/Opus/FastStream/LC3plus | Keep disabled despite independently installed decoder libraries; no user-value case strong enough for initial release |
| LHDC / BlueALSA 5.0 | Separate upgrade/ABI/binary-license project, not prerequisite for sensible SBC/AAC/aptX/LDAC policy |

Explicitly enumerate approved configure enables/disables and runtime codecs;
never use `--all-codecs`. In 4.3.1 some optional codecs are not runtime-enabled
by default even if compiled: check Manager1.Codecs rather than assuming library
presence. Generate a read-only codec manifest from actual configured outputs,
not hand-written marketing metadata. Record encoder versions, options, license
status, quality profile and qualification ID with the firmware artifact.

Cross-build assertions must reject unexpected encoders, format adapters,
missing source/license files and disagreement among manifest, configure output,
ELF dependencies and runtime inventory. No downloads at playback time. No broad
FFmpeg encoder enablement; file AAC/MP3/Opus decoding remains independent.

## 14. Qualification, release categories and next sequence

The full [test and physical matrix](../audit/bluetooth-codecs/2026-09-22-evidence-and-tests.md)
covers remote capabilities, CPU/memory/thermal/battery, four Wi-Fi states,
LDAC fixed/adaptive modes, lifecycle/failure injection and precision checks.
All physical codec qualification remains outstanding; host policy tests cannot
prove radio, CPU, battery or headphone behavior.

| Category | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| SHIP recommendation, after baseline qualification and distribution review | SBC with normal high quality and conservative fallback. Current public Bluetooth release qualification: **none** |
| EXPERIMENTAL, qualify one at a time | AAC, aptX, aptX HD, LDAC 303/330 and 606/660, capped adaptive when interface exists; SBC XQ. AAC/aptX/HD may graduate after gates |
| EXPERIMENTAL, lower priority / never initial Auto | LDAC 909/990, LDAC 88.2/96 kHz, SBC XQ+; higher radio/CPU/interoperability exposure |
| DO NOT SHIP initial Reborn | LHDC, LC3plus, MPEG/MP3 A2DP, Android/PipeWire Opus extensions, FastStream, aptX LL/TWS; low proven value or major integration/distribution gaps |
| Not realistically supported by present product stack | aptX Adaptive/Lossless; no suitable encoder/transport integration and proprietary ecosystem requirements |
| IMPOSSIBLE / HARDWARE LIMITED on present controller interface | Standard LE Audio/LC3 CIS/BIS and Auracast |

Proposed correction sequence:

1. Close SBC baseline evidence and the pairing/trust/reconnect ownership gap.
   Refresh the Y2Linux standing milestone audit with actual evidence before any
   production-scope expansion; this document does not activate a milestone.
2. Add typed observations and exact PCM-format contract; expose truthful existing
   SBC state. Add fake-bus stale-generation/malformed/unsupported tests.
3. Add the pure policy plus bounded negotiation coordinator, SBC conservative
   fallback and compact persistence. Prove no flapping/exhaustion behavior.
4. Resolve exact dependency/distribution decisions; qualify optional codecs one
   at a time, starting with the actual owner's available headphone capabilities.
   AAC is high user value; aptX is an attractive lower-CPU comparison; measure.
5. Only then add LDAC quality extension/capability telemetry if the platform
   results justify it. Keep a small codec menu and one pipeline.
6. Produce a candidate through the existing production packaging workflow, with
   explicit codec manifest/source/legal payload and test identities. Stop for
   owner-controlled physical installation/qualification—never touch protected
   partitions or calibration as part of codec work.

**No implementation, commits, new production artifact or installation occurred
in this audit.** The next useful external input is real headphone capability and
baseline playback evidence, not permission to enable every encoder.
