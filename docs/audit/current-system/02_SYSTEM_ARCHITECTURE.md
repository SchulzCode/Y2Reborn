## Boot and persistent storage

```text
MT6582 Boot ROM
  -> retained stock preloader (DRAM/platform assumptions)
  -> retained stock LK
  -> BOOTIMG: Android boot header + Linux 6.18 + DT + rescue initramfs
       -> /init: proc/sys/dev/run/tmp, platform and display preparation
          +-> forced rescue / failed storage or compatibility checks
          |     -> RAM-resident recovery/diagnostic environment
          +-> charger-only/low-battery gate -> offline-charge program
          |     (no normal Y2ROOT/Reborn/radio startup)
          `-> identify internal eMMC by controller, geometry, label, UUID
              -> read-only noload root preflight and compatibility checks
              -> e2fsck -p; unacceptable result -> rescue
              -> mount Y2ROOT rw + Y2DATA rw,nosuid,nodev
              -> expose BOOTIMG-owned modules from /run/y2/modules
              -> switch_root -> BusyBox init / rcS
                  -> platform/data setup -> Reborn supervisor
                  -> USB/display/system logging/D-Bus/radio/SSH services
```

`Y2ROOT` reuses stock ANDROID; `Y2DATA` reuses USRDATA. The tested addressing contract distinguishes scatter coordinates from native eMMC coordinates. Linux's Y2-specific stock-logical translation is essential; it is not generic eMMC behavior. Preloader/LK/partition tables/NVRAM/calibration are not update targets. `Y2DATA.img` is an initialization seed, not an update payload. A/B slots and automatic rollback are not implemented.

Evidence: [production init](../../../../Y2Linux/initramfs/production/init), [layout](../../../../Y2Linux/tools/production/layout.py), [package](../../../../Y2Linux/tools/production/package.py), [storage translation patch](../../../../Y2Linux/kernel/patches/0023-y2-stock-emmc-capacity.patch), [data startup](../../../../Y2Linux/buildroot/board/y2/production-overlay/etc/init.d/S02y2-data).

## Hardware ownership map

```text
Linux 6.18 + canonical Y2 DT + hashed patch/overlay manifest
 |
 +-- clocks/pinctrl/EINT/PWRAP -> MT6323 MFD/regmap
 |    +-- regulators / ADC / charger power_supply / PMIC keys / RTC / poweroff
 +-- SPM -> CPU hotplug/suspend + MFG generic power domain
 +-- cpufreq-dt / CPU cooling -> fixed-voltage OPPs
 +-- thermal + efuse calibration -> CPU and PMIC die observations
 +-- DRM mediatek -> OVL/RDMA/COLOR/DSI/PHY -> panel/backlight

 +-- ALSA/ASoC -> MT6582 AFE DL1 -> I2S -> CS43131 -> headphone pins
 `-- one CONSYS parent -> rails/reset/BTIF-DMA/STP/WMT/firmware/calibration

```

Canonical files: [DT](../../../../Y2Linux/kernel/dts/innioasis-y2.dts), [platform drivers](../../../../Y2Linux/kernel/platform), [audio drivers](../../../../Y2Linux/kernel/audio), [patch manifest](../../../../Y2Linux/kernel/patches/manifest.json). The production DTS includes the common DTS; there is not an independent second hardware design. Low-level register constants often originate in vendor/donor evidence; their named policy wrappers improve reviewability but do not independently validate electrical assumptions.

Memory intent is 0x3e000000 bytes in DT (992 MiB), minus reserved regions, kernel and other allocations—not a freely available 1 GiB heap. The historical LK gap is reserved, as is connectivity-owned high memory. HIGHMEM, a 3G/1G split, 100-Hz tick and NO_HZ_IDLE are configured; CMA is disabled. The audit does not propose changing these boundaries.

## Processes, services and persistence

```text

```

Evidence: [Reborn packaging and services](../../../../Y2Linux/buildroot/package/reborn), [connectivity service](../../../../Y2Linux/buildroot/board/y2/production-overlay/usr/libexec/y2/connectivity), [SSH configuration](../../../../Y2Linux/buildroot/board/y2/overlay/etc/default/dropbear), [media mount helper](../../../../Y2Linux/buildroot/board/y2/production-overlay/usr/sbin/y2-media).

Reborn starts before optional radios; workers must tolerate unavailable providers. Screen blanking is not deep suspend. `y2-suspend` independently enforces activity/radio policy; playback/radio activity leases prevent inappropriate suspend. There is no evidence that merely sleeping the UI implements a complete battery standby policy.

## Reborn state and data flow

```text
evdev -> InputManager -> normalized controls -> ActionRouter -> Action
                                                               |
control socket -> enumerated commands --------------------------+
                                                               v
main/UI thread: Runtime owns AppModel + Ui + graphics + service handles
  Ui::action(&mut AppModel, ...) -> Effect -> Runtime::effect
  service events -------------> AppModel::apply / Runtime handlers
  Ui::draw(&AppModel, ...) ----> quads -> native GLES renderer -> KMS
      (draw does not own hardware or perform service IO)

Runtime -> scanner worker -> FFmpeg metadata -> DB command queue (32)
                          -> SQLite worker/connection -> paged query reply
Runtime -> decode worker -> bounded PCM stream -> audio worker -> AudioSink
Runtime -> Wi-Fi worker -> supplicant control + rfkill/preference
Runtime -> BT worker -> BlueZ/BlueALSA D-Bus + pairing agent
Runtime -> diagnostics worker -> bounded tests/bundles
all -> Observer -> bounded event/metric state + bounded logger worker
```

The model is the UI/session authority, but not yet the sole playback authority: the decode worker owns a copied upcoming-track list. This is actual architectural drift, not a second intentional queue service. UI navigation mutates AppModel directly while returning effects; this is not a fully pure reducer architecture, and need not become one. The useful boundary is that presentation does not own device/DB/decoder handles.

Production sources: [runtime](../../../app/reborn/src/main.rs), [playback](../../../app/reborn/src/playback.rs), [model](../../../crates/reborn-core/src/lib.rs), [library](../../../crates/reborn-library/src/lib.rs), [UI](../../../crates/reborn-ui/src/lib.rs).

## Actual audio and graphics dependencies

```text
file -> FFmpeg demux/decode -> swresample to stereo FLTP at source rate
     -> avfilter volume/RG + optional EQ + always limiter
        (limiter negotiates packed double internally; back to FLTP)
     -> swresample to job output rate / packed S16 or S32
     -> optional crossfade window conversions/mix -> audio worker
        +-- wired ALSA hw:Y2Audio -> S16-only AFE -> 32-bit I2S slots -> DAC
        `-- BlueALSA ALSA PCM -> bluealsad SBC -> BlueZ -> HCI -> headphones

quads + bitmap font/icon atlas + 160x160 artwork
 -> GLES2 textures/draws -> EGL/GBM front buffer
 -> DRM FB/pageflip -> panel scanout
```

The S32 transport representation is not proof of 32-bit precision. A 32-bit slot is not a 32-bit sample. Bluetooth does share the main processed PCM, but has additional BlueALSA encoding/transport buffering and a separately negotiated PCM rate. See [audio](05_AUDIO_AUDIT.md).

## Production build authority and legacy

`tools/production/build.py` orchestrates the pinned kernel inputs, Buildroot external tree, board overlays, sibling Reborn source, owner firmware inputs, image construction and package validation. Reborn's `tools/build/cross.sh` consumes the Buildroot SDK with locked/vendored Cargo dependencies. Reborn's local packaging and preview helpers are not substitutes for the system image build.

First-boot/development configurations, Y2PlayerNative manifest placeholders, old UI packs/previews and historical milestone reports are legacy/reference material. Some recovery/development tools still matter; do not delete them solely because they are old. The native Wi-Fi vendor-derived core remains production code despite its legacy shape. The separation between these categories needs better documentation, not wholesale relocation of the repositories.
