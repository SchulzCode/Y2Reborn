# Executive assessment

**Keep the architecture; stabilize its integration contracts.** This is a substantial working embedded-platform foundation with a credible application skeleton, not a production-ready music player. The largest problems are specific lifecycle/state/data-integrity defects and unclosed physical qualification—not a need for another framework, another UI rewrite, or more abstraction layers.

Assessment: platform layering is generally sound; application layering is promising but incompletely enforced; release engineering and validation are behind implementation. Overall **PARTIAL / HIGH confidence**. Public beta or stable claims would be premature. A tightly scoped owner/developer alpha becomes credible after the P0 correctness work and P1 installation, power, persistence and audio evidence gates.

## What is genuinely good

The boot path fails closed on unexpected storage identity, preserves a rescue environment, distinguishes data initialization from preserving updates, and limits production image targets. Native Linux subsystem use is real: DRM/KMS/Lima, ASoC/ALSA, evdev, cfg80211, HCI/BlueZ, power_supply/regulator/thermal interfaces. These are valuable foundations to retain.

Reborn has a shared FFmpeg processing path for wired and Bluetooth output, bounded channels, cancellation generations, a single SQLite worker, explicit semantic input, a largely hardware-free presentation layer, atomic session-file replacement, and bounded diagnostic infrastructure. These are inspected implementations, not merely architecture diagrams. See GOOD findings G01–G10 in the [master table](13_MASTER_FINDINGS.md).

## The small set of decisive problems

1. **Playback lifecycle is not coherent.** `Runtime::load` probes an exclusive ALSA device before stopping the existing sink; volume, seek and other normal controls call this path. Controls can fail with the old stream still alive, and successful changes rebuild playback. F02.
2. **The visible queue is not the playing queue.** A worker receives a copied queue, while subsequent UI edits mutate only the model. Repeat-one, duplicates and album selection also have concrete semantic defects. F03/F08.
3. **The media boundary leaks an AVFrame allocation per decoded source frame.** The caller never frees the moved-from frame shell. A cached-host repeated-decode probe supports the source finding; target growth is unmeasured. F01.
4. **Every normal nonzero UI crossfade duration can exceed the real ALSA sink's block bound.** The UI offers 5/10/15 seconds; overlap is emitted as one block, whereas a 44.1-kHz S16 block is limited to about 2.97 seconds. The 50-ms fake-sink test misses this. F04.
5. **Persistence success is overstated.** Scanner writes are not acknowledged before successful completion/pruning, corrupt DB recovery is absent, and the entire session/queue is synchronously rewritten every 15 seconds even when unchanged. F05/F06/F07.

These are fixable integration defects, not grounds for discarding Rust, FFmpeg, SQLite or the current UI boundary.

## Claims that must be narrowed now

* Wired production output is **S16_LE stereo at 44.1 kHz**. The AFE exposes S16 at 44.1/48 kHz, and the release profile admits only 44.1 kHz. A 24/96 FLAC is decoded, processed and reduced to the qualified output. S32 hardware output and preserved 24-bit output are **MISSING**, not awaiting only a listening test. F10.
* FFmpeg really is **9.0.1** in the inspected build; its selected codec set is sensible. But the scanner excludes AIFF, APE and WavPack, despite decoder fixtures. F09.
* Gapless has meaningful sample-count/boundary evidence for two synthetic same-rate FLAC files. Universal sample-accurate lossy/mixed-rate/real-device gapless is **UNKNOWN**. F11.
* Bluetooth audio codecs enabled in the inspected image build: **SBC**. AAC, aptX, aptX HD and LDAC are not enabled. Wi-Fi scanning and concurrent adapter power are physically evidenced; association/DHCP/DNS, pairing/A2DP and sustained coexistence are not. F18/F19.
* Older owner power acceptance does not qualify current charger changes, cell-temperature behavior, unattended charging or same-boot deep suspend. GPU01 recorded a genuine CPU3 suspend blocker; a subsequent correction is not equivalent to successful physical resume. F16/F17.

## Biggest entirely missing pieces

There is no meaningful wired S32/high-rate AFE implementation, usable EQ band/preset configuration despite the toggle, Reborn AVRCP player/control integration, application-level low-battery shutdown policy, corrupt-library recovery workflow, or public redistribution/compliance bundle. exFAT is absent from the supported SD mounting path. Some are stable-release requirements; some can be explicitly excluded from a truthful alpha. See the missing-functionality matrix in [release gaps](10_RELEASE_GAPS.md); do not treat every absent feature as P0.

## Release decision

| Dimension | Current judgment |
| --- | --- |
| Installation/recovery | Strong owner tooling; public install/update instructions and artifact contract still weak. |
| Core audio/controls | Blocking lifecycle, queue, crossfade and memory defects. |
| Library/persistence | Useful baseline; failure handling and large-library behavior insufficient. |
| UI | Redesignable without replacing services, but several displayed/action semantics are wrong. |
| Connectivity | Native stack exists; peer/network qualification open. |
| Power | Conservative mechanisms exist; safety and current regression evidence incomplete. |
| Diagnostics | Useful and appropriately bounded; some counters/status claims need correction. |
| Licensing/reproducibility | Private owner build path is much stronger than public redistribution path. |
