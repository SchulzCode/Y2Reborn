# Reborn Product UI v2

<!-- knowledge-base-scope: source-contract -->
> **Source-contract scope.** This page describes the Product UI v2 source
> (Reborn 0.2.0). See [current state](../CURRENT_REBORN_STATE.md) for what is
> installed and physically observed; built does not mean qualified.

Reborn is a dedicated music player for the Innioasis Y2 (480×360, scroll
wheel and buttons, no touch). Product UI v2 keeps the existing visual
language (dark background, warm gold accent, one licensed sans atlas, one
icon atlas) and removes everything a listener does not need. The
navigation tree is in [REBORN-PRODUCT-NAVIGATION-V2](REBORN-PRODUCT-NAVIGATION-V2.md);
the platform boundary is in [platform-api-boundary](../architecture/platform-api-boundary.md);
the audit and pruning ledger is in [REBORN-PRODUCT-PASS-V2](../review/REBORN-PRODUCT-PASS-V2.md).

## Principles

1. Every normal screen answers "would a person using a music player use
   this?". If not, it is removed, merged, moved to Diagnostics or hidden.
2. Normal screens never show Linux, driver, service, transport, schema or
   signing vocabulary. A test fails the build if they do
   (`normal_screens_never_show_engineering_terms_or_generic_unavailable`).
3. There is no generic "Unavailable". A state names itself: *Wi-Fi Is Off*,
   *No SD card*, *Connecting…*, *Connect to Wi-Fi to Check for Updates*,
   *Updates Are Installed with a Computer*, *Song Not Found*.
4. A problem state has a short heading, one explanation and one useful
   action. Raw errors appear only in Diagnostics.
5. Exactly one focus on every interactive screen. Static fact pages
   (Battery, Storage, Song Info) have no focus because nothing on them acts.

## Layout system

| Region | Geometry | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Status bar | 0–28 px | Playing glyph (gold) · Wi-Fi and Bluetooth glyphs (bright when connected) · battery % and icon, `+` while charging, red when low |
| Title | y 40, 20 px | Screen name; long lists show a muted position counter |
| Content | 76–316 px | Five 46 px rows on a 48 px pitch, or hero + facts + rows |
| Footer | 324–360 px | Mini player (art, title, artist, state) or one status line (radio progress/problem) |

* **Rows**: 15 px label, 12 px secondary, optional 12 px duration. Focus is a
  gold outline with a warm fill; the playing track has a small gold play
  glyph. Long lists draw a thin scroll rail.
* **Hero**: 20 px heading (up to two lines) and 14 px body (up to three
  lines) for off, empty, progress and error states.
* **Facts**: two columns, 14 px label left and value right, 34 px pitch.
* **Sheets** (Quick Settings, options, pickers, confirmations): centred,
  sized to content, up to six 40 px rows; destructive confirmations start on
  *Cancel* and name their action (*Power Off*, *Forget*, *Rebuild*).
* **Toasts**: one line above the footer for 1.8 s.

Minimum functional text is 12 px; normal list text is 15 px. Accent gold is
used for focus, the playing glyph, progress and active shuffle/repeat only.

## Screens

**Home** — Music, Now Playing (current title), Queue (song count), Settings.

**Music** — Albums, Artists, Songs, Folders. Album and Artist pages show art,
name and secondary line above *Play All*, then tracks; album rows omit the
artist when it equals the album artist. Folders' roots are *Internal Storage*
and *SD Card*. Empty lists explain themselves (*No Music Yet*, *Finding Your
Music…*, *Library Scan Didn't Finish*, *Can't Read Your Music*) and offer
*Scan for Music* where useful.

**Now Playing** — 176 px art, title (up to three lines), artist, album,
state (*Playing*, *Paused*, *SD card removed*, *No audio output* with one
hint), progress with elapsed/remaining, and a volume bar. The wheel changes
volume by a fixed 2 per detent; Select opens Now Playing options: Show
Queue, Shuffle, Repeat, Go to Album, Go to Artist, Song Info. The footer
shows the output and shuffle/repeat state.

**Queue** — ordered occurrences, the current one marked. Hold Select:
Play Now, Remove from Queue, Move Up, Move Down, Clear Upcoming (confirmed).

**Song Info** — Title, Artist, Album, Length, Format (`FLAC · 96 kHz`),
File, Location (Internal Storage / SD Card).

**Settings** — Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, PC Transfer, Audio, Playback, Library,
Display, System, each with a one-line summary.

* **Wi-Fi**: Wi-Fi toggle, joined network first (*Connected*, *Connecting…*,
  *Getting network address…*, *Connected · No internet*, *Couldn't
  connect*), saved and nearby networks with signal words, *Search Again*.
  Off: *Wi-Fi Is Off* + *Turn On Wi-Fi*. Problems in the footer: wrong
  password, no address, no name lookup, network not found.
* **Bluetooth**: toggle, devices (*Playing audio · AAC*, *Connected*,
  *Paired*, *Not paired*), *Search for Devices*. A connected device opens
  Disconnect, Use for Audio, Codec (only with a real choice), Forget Device.
* **PC Transfer**: *Connect to a Computer*, *Preparing PC Transfer…*, *PC
  Transfer Ready*, *PC Transfer Disconnected*, free space and *Scan for New
  Music*.
* **Audio**: Output (picker: Headphone jack and connected Bluetooth
  devices), ReplayGain (Off/Track/Album).
* **Playback**: Shuffle, Repeat (Off/All/One), Gapless Playback, Crossfade
  (Off/3/6/10 s).
* **Library**: Internal Storage and SD Card song counts, *Scan for New
  Music*, *Rebuild Library* (confirmed; re-reads every file, never empties
  the library).
* **Display**: Brightness (20–100 %, shown only when the backlight has
  levels), Screen Timeout (15 s – 5 min, Never).
* **System**: Battery, Storage, Software Update, About, Reset &
  Maintenance, Diagnostics, Restart, Power Off.

**Battery** — charge % when the platform publishes a valid estimate and the
charging state; *Low Battery* / *Battery Critically Low* heroes. Transitions
to Low and Critical are announced once by a toast.

**Storage** — Internal Storage and SD Card as *3.2 GB free of 6.4 GB*, *No
SD card* or *SD card error · Reinsert the card*; *Storage Running Low* /
*Storage Almost Full* heroes.

**Software Update** — *Software Update* (check), *Checking for Updates…*,
*Up to Date*, *Update Available* (download), *Downloading Update…*, *Ready
to Install* (Restart to Install / Cancel Update, confirmed), *Installing
Update…*, and named failures (*Connect to Wi-Fi to Check for Updates*,
*Updates Are Installed with a Computer*, *Not Enough Space for the Update*,
*Update Couldn't Be Verified*, *Update Didn't Finish*). No keys, sequences,
manifests or journals.

**About** — Reborn 0.2.0, System *Y2Linux 1.0.0*, Device *Innioasis Y2*,
Licenses.

**Reset & Maintenance** — Reset Reborn Settings, Forget Wi-Fi Networks,
Remove Bluetooth Pairings, Rebuild Music Library, Clear Cache. Each is a
real operation behind a confirmation that states its consequence. A full
user-data wipe is not offered on the device.

**Quick Settings** (hold Power) — Wi-Fi and Bluetooth toggle in place,
Output, Brightness, Restart, Power Off.

**Diagnostics** (Settings → System → Diagnostics) — see the
[navigation map](REBORN-PRODUCT-NAVIGATION-V2.md#diagnostics-tree).

## Boot and shutdown

The early splash (Y2Linux `tools/graphics/reborn-splash.c`) shows the Reborn
wordmark, one thin white bar and a short status line on the product
background. Its pixels are generated from Reborn's own boot screens
(`reborn_ui::boot_screen`) and a cross-repository test proves the splash and
Reborn's hand-off frame are identical. The bar fills to coarse real startup
milestones and never shows a number. The splash keeps the display until
Reborn's first complete UI frame is ready; that frame is presented under the
full boot screen, which dissolves over seven frames (~240 ms). See
[boot progress and hand-off](../architecture/boot-handoff.md).

On a platform shutdown or restart intent Reborn dissolves the UI into the same
screen (**Saving**), saves the session and closes audio and the library
database, shows **Shutting down** (or **Restarting**, **Battery empty**) while
the bar drains and the screen dims, presents a black frame, turns the
backlight off and then acknowledges (23 frames at ~34 ms ≈ 0.8 s of visuals
plus the save time). The platform turns the backlight off before it stops a
Reborn that did not acknowledge, and again before init powers down, so a
crashed or hung Reborn cannot leave a lit panel.

## Wheel

One physical detent is one step everywhere. Only long library lists
(Albums, Artists, Songs, Folders, Album, Artist with at least 40 rows)
honour the input layer's acceleration, which needs a sustained rotation of
four or more detents and resets on a 220 ms pause or reversal. Settings,
Queue, sheets and password entry move one row, item or value per detent;
Now Playing changes volume by a fixed step. See
[the pass report](../review/REBORN-PRODUCT-PASS-V2.md#7-wheel).
