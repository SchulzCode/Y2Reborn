All rows traverse top-to-bottom in displayed order, skipping disabled actions.
Visible windows contain five rows, or three below album/artist art. Counter shows
position/total. Select opens/acts; Back restores parent filter/focus/scroll. Long
Back returns Home unless closing a modal. Every interactive view has one focus.
Boot and locked root-install preparation are noninteractive and have no focus.

Global Play/Pause, Previous/Next and Volume remain available through ordinary
views, dialogs, pairing and password entry, subject to the existing input router.
Volume never navigates. Screen-off navigation is ignored. Long Play opens Now
Playing only outside a focus trap. Long Select means Context, or password submit.
An unavailable context is a deliberate no-op, not an empty menu. No touch paths.

The physical focus test is automated over every normal screen and platform page,
with empty/populated variants. Every enabled row is reached deterministically by
wheel-only traversal and Back returns to a parent/root. Hardware input timing,
legibility and physical focus visibility require owner qualification.
