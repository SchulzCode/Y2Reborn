# Reborn UI v1 owner qualification

Software candidate only. No screenshot, host test or ARM emulation result is a
physical pass. Confirm the candidate hashes and exact required Platform v1
BOOTIMG before any owner-controlled installation. Ordinary review/update must
preserve Y2DATA and all protected/factory partitions. This task does not flash.
Use the Platform v1 owner sessions A–G for hardware prerequisites and record the
actual boot/build IDs with results.

- [ ] At normal viewing distance, inspect 12/15/20/26 px text, long metadata,
      accented Latin/Greek/Cyrillic and the documented CJK fallback. Photograph
      clipping, low contrast or insufficient focus contrast.
- [ ] From the first row on every navigation-map screen, reach every enabled
      item with the wheel; verify one outline, deterministic acceleration and
      disabled-row skipping. Test the letter index on 1k/10k/20k libraries.
- [ ] Enter album, artist, artist albums, folders and track details; Back restores
      exact filter/focus/scroll. Long Back reaches Home; no dead ends.
- [ ] Exercise collection and individual track contexts separately. Play Next
      and Add to Queue must use the intended scope. Check repeated tracks and
      reordered queue occurrence identity; move only future entries, confirm
      Clear Future, cancel without changing data.
- [ ] Inspect Now Playing art, title, artist, album, progress and paused/error
      states. Compare Audio Info source precision/rate with actual S16/44.1 sink.
- [ ] Check real embedded and sidecar art, absent artwork, rapid album changes,
      SD replacement, cache memory and return from screen off.
- [ ] While playing and paused, test global Play/Pause, Previous/Next, long seek,
      Volume, long Play and Power. Repeat with context, pairing and password
      overlays. Volume must never move focus.
- [ ] Blank the panel, turn the wheel and press Select/Back: focus stays still.
      Playback and volume continue according to input policy. Power wakes the
      retained screen; there is no indefinitely rendered lock view.
- [ ] Verify off/starting/scanning/associating/authenticated/DHCP/DNS/Online Wi-Fi
      states, wrong password, missing network, disconnect, saved reconnect,
      forget and long SSID. Confirm unsupported security is not treated as open.
- [ ] Pair SBC headphones with named-device/code confirmation, cancel a request,
      reconnect/disconnect/forget and use wired output. Inspect actual codec,
      PCM/rate/channels, trusted state and reconnect in Diagnostics. Verify
      AVRCP Play/Pause/Next/Previous updates the same Now Playing/queue state.
      Auto must remain unavailable with the current empty eligible codec list.
- [ ] Connect/disconnect USB and verify cable/ECM/SFTP/address/space. Perform
      authenticated USB SFTP using existing owner tooling. Confirm Wi-Fi does
      not expose the USB SFTP listener. UI does not invent active-transfer counts.
- [ ] Test internal storage, absent/mounted/removed SD, low/critical free space,
      malformed media and interrupted scans. Usable rows remain visible; failed
      scans do not prune previous rows or claim success. Check the Scan Status
      detail and the distinct Rebuild maintenance scope.
- [ ] Inspect Power with/without USB: voltage and charging/source state only.
      No SOC/runtime/battery-temperature estimate. Unqualified low-battery
      thresholds remain disabled. Do not create a battery depletion experiment.
- [ ] Check trusted/untrusted clock and synchronization source. Wrong RTC time
      must not appear as an established clock.
- [ ] Review OTA state/check/stage/verification/result, unavailable admission,
      queued install confirmation/cancel and existing rollback representation.
      Actual update/interruption testing belongs to Platform v1 Session F, with
      its recovery prerequisites. Do not inject failures from the normal UI.
- [ ] Export settings/player data and retrieve the recorded archive via USB;
      confirm the declared secret exclusions. Review all six reset descriptions;
      full-user music deletion must be clearly distinct. Execution remains the
      stopped-service owner maintenance workflow.
- [ ] Check Health/Capabilities, CPU frequency/load, RSS/PSS, die temperatures,
      cooling, storage, network IP/route/DNS, Bluetooth PCM, audio source/sink,
      USB and updater states against independent platform observations.
- [ ] Run only the confirmed private-scratch storage/library checks when the
      device and data have the Platform v1 prerequisites. Read actual results.
      Cancel confirmations and verify no work starts. No user music is a target.
- [ ] Record target UI frame times, dropped input, RSS/PSS and audio underruns
      during browsing, rapid art changes, scans and radio activity. Verify idle
      menus stop rendering and notice expiry causes one final redraw.
- [ ] Test safe power-off/restart confirmations and service failures. Confirm
      pending root apply/restore blocks conflicting actions and reports failure
      if preparation is refused. Record previous-boot state after owner restart.

Record PASS/FAIL/NOT TESTED per item with exact candidate hash, output/peer/card,
observed values and evidence path. Remaining hardware gates are not silently
accepted because the UI can display them.
