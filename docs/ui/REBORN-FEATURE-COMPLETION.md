# Product v2 feature-completion controls

<!-- knowledge-base-scope: source-contract -->

This pass extends Product v2. It does not claim physical sleep, codec or audio
qualification. Current output capabilities still come from the platform.

- **Audio → Equalizer:** enable the existing FFmpeg EQ/limiter, edit five broad
  bands at 60/250/1000/4000/12000 Hz, or reset to flat. Each wheel detent changes
  the candidate gain by 1 dB, bounded to ±12 dB. Select applies; Back cancels.
  Values are persisted with the existing settings. Playback uses its existing
  transactional reconfiguration and rollback. Reset Settings now also removes
  an active EQ from the running pipeline.
- **Audio → Output Details:** source codec/bits/rate, decoder/DSP precision and
  the accepted PCM format/rate live in Diagnostics. The accepted PCM container
  is not proof of the DAC's meaningful payload bits.
- **System → Sleep** and **Quick Settings → Sleep:** deliberate sleep is
  distinct from a short Power press, which blanks the display while retaining
  playback. Playing/buffering refuses sleep with a Pause action explanation.
  The platform owns admission; current software refuses ordinary deep sleep
  until same-boot physical qualification is complete. Requested, refused,
  sleeping, restoring, restored and restore-failed are typed product states.
  A restored claim additionally needs same_boot=true and kernel_completed=true.
- **Bluetooth:** codec preference and the observed device codec remain separate.
  A paused player can now select a codec; there is no hidden requirement to use
  a command-line Stop action. Existing transport and PCM lease guards remain.
  Optional choices require the current enabled/mutual capability set, discovered
  read-only when the transport first appears. The saved preference is attempted
  once per observed connection after playback is paused/stopped; replacement PCM
  objects do not retrigger it. SBC-only peers still expose their quality setting.
  SBC quality and LDAC quality/Auto Rate controls use the platform's supported
  settings. Saved changes say **restart required**; Diagnostics distinguishes
  saved values from the current daemon's startup receipt. LDAC quality labels
  give both rate families: 303/330, 606/660, 909/990 kbps. ABR enabled is a
  control state, not evidence that adaptation has been observed.
- **Diagnostics → Export Diagnostic Report:** creates the platform's redacted
  shareable report, then opens Latest Result with its archive path and retrieval
  instruction. **Export Player Data** is explicitly a private backup.
- **Battery:** voltage-derived percentage is labelled **Estimated Charge**.
  No current, coulomb or battery temperature measurements are invented.

The ready-frame boot handoff and black-frame/backlight-off shutdown sequence
from the entry source remain in use. The wheel's input duplicate suppression,
acceleration and direction-reset logic is unchanged; the EQ picker uses the
existing one-detent value policy. Long modal lists now compute visible rows
from the actual description height so the focused row remains on screen.

Validation: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, strict workspace clippy and 238
workspace tests passed, including API-boundary, shutdown and input tests.
`reborn-preview` emits 69 deterministic native-resolution cases; the new EQ,
long EQ picker, sleep refusal and LDAC settings cases were rendered and viewed.
These fixtures are presentation validation, not observations from a device.
